Timmy was so happy and grateful to Lily. He went to meet her uncle and he taught him how to ride the motorcycle safely.

Tom was a troubled boy. He did not like to eat his food. He only liked to eat candy and cake. His mom and dad were sad. They wanted Tom to be healthy and strong.
One day, mom made a soup for dinner. She put celery in the soup. She said, "Tom, this soup is good for you. It has celery. Celery is green and crunchy. It makes you grow and learn. Please try some."
Tom looked at the soup. He saw the celery. He did not want to eat it. He said, "No, mom. I do not like celery. It is yucky and bitter. I want candy and cake."
Mom sighed. She said, "Tom, you cannot have candy and cake every day. They are bad for you. They make you sick and tired. You need to eat your soup. It is warm and tasty. It has carrots and potatoes and chicken too. They are all good for you."
Tom shook his head. He said, "No, mom. I do not like soup. I do not like carrots and potatoes and chicken. I only like candy and cake."
Mom was sad. She said, "Tom, you are being stubborn and rude. You are hurting my feelings. You are not listening to me. You are not thanking God for your food. You need to pray and ask God to help you eat your soup."
Tom did not know what to do. He did not want to hurt mom's feelings. He did not want to be stubborn and rude. He did not want to make God angry. He wanted to be a good boy. He looked at the soup. He looked at mom. He looked at dad. He closed his eyes. He said, "God, please help me. I do not like soup. I do not like celery. But I love mom and dad. And I love you. Please make me eat my soup. Please make me like celery. Please make me healthy and strong. Amen."

Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. They also like to make jokes and tricks. One day, they find a big box in the living room. It has a bow and a tag. The tag says: "To Anna and Ben, from Santa".
Anna and Ben are very happy. They think Santa came early this year. They want to open the box and see what is inside. But they also want to wait for Christmas. They are confused. What should they do?
They decide to make a plan. They will open the box very carefully and see what is inside. Then they will wrap it again and put it back. They will act surprised on Christmas. They think this is a good joke.
They open the box and see a big teddy bear. It is soft and brown. It has a red scarf and a hat. Anna and Ben love it. They hug it and play with it. They forget about their plan. They forget about the time.
Mom and Dad come home. They see Anna and Ben with the teddy bear. They see the box and the paper. They are not happy. They are angry. They ask Anna and Ben what they did. Anna and Ben are scared. They try to lie. They say they found the teddy bear outside. They say they did not open the box.
Mom and Dad know the truth. They are not stupid. They tell Anna and Ben that they are naughty. They tell them that they broke the rule. They tell them that they have to say sorry. They tell them that they have to give back the teddy bear. They tell them that they have to wait for Christmas.
Anna and Ben are sad. They cry. They say sorry. They give back the teddy bear. They wrap it again and put it back. They learn their lesson. They do not make jokes and tricks with presents. They do not lie to Mom and Dad. They wait for Christmas. They hope Santa will forgive them.




Anna liked to examine things. She liked to look at them and touch them and ask questions. She wanted to know how they worked and why they were different. She examined her toys, her books, her clothes, and her pets.
One day, she decided to examine the bathtub. She climbed on a stool and looked inside. She saw water, soap, bubbles, and a rubber duck. She touched the water and felt it was warm. She touched the soap and felt it was slippery. She touched the bubbles and felt them pop. She touched the rubber duck and felt it squeak.
She thought the bathtub was attractive. It was shiny and white and had pretty patterns on the tiles. She liked the colors and the shapes. She liked how the water sparkled and the bubbles floated. She liked how the rubber duck smiled and the soap smelled.
She wanted to play in the bathtub. She took off her clothes and jumped in. She splashed and laughed and made more bubbles. She hugged the rubber duck and washed it with the soap. She had fun in the bathtub.
She did not hear her mom calling her. She did not see her mom coming in. She did not notice her mom's face. She only noticed her mom's voice when she said, "Anna, what are you doing? You are making a mess! You are supposed to examine things with your eyes, not with your whole body!"




Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They had a small plant that they watered every day. The plant had green leaves and purple flowers.
One day, Anna was feeling bossy. She wanted to water the plant by herself. She said to Ben, "Go away, this is my plant. You can't touch it."
Ben was sad and angry. He said, "No, it is our plant. We share it. You are not nice."
Anna and Ben started to fight. They pulled the plant from each other. The plant was hurt. Some of the leaves and flowers fell off.
Anna and Ben stopped fighting. They saw the plant and felt sorry. They said to the plant, "We are sorry, plant. We did not mean to hurt you. Please forgive us."
The plant did not say anything. But it still looked alive. Anna and Ben decided to be nice to each other and to the plant. They hugged and said, "We are friends. We share the plant. We are not bossy."
They watered the plant together and put it in a sunny spot. The plant was happy. It grew new leaves and flowers. Anna and Ben were happy too. They played in the garden and took care of the plant. They learned to forgive and share.




Tom and Mia were playing on the beach. They liked to find shells and make piles of them. Tom found a big shell that was shiny and had many colors. He was very happy and showed it to Mia.
"Look, Mia, I found a nice shell!" he said.
Mia looked at the shell and frowned. She recognized it. It was the same shell that she had found yesterday and left on her towel. She thought Tom had taken it from her.
"That is my shell, Tom!" she said. "You took it from me!"
Tom was confused and sad. He did not take the shell from Mia. He found it in the sand. He did not want to make Mia angry.
"No, Mia, I did not take your shell. I found it here. See, there are more shells like it." he said and pointed to the sand.
Mia did not believe him. She thought he was lying. She wanted her shell back. She tried to grab it from Tom's hand.
"Give me my shell, Tom! It is mine!" she said.
Tom did not want to give up his shell. He liked it too much. He held it tight and pulled it away from Mia.
"No, Mia, it is my shell! I found it first!" he said.
They both pulled and tugged on the shell. They were both angry and loud. They did not hear their mom calling them.
"Tom! Mia! Come here, please!" their mom said.
She saw them fighting over the shell. She was not happy. She walked over to them and took the shell from their hands.
"Stop it, both of you! What is going on?" she said.
Tom and Mia both tried to explain. They both said the shell was theirs. They both said the other one was wrong.
Their mom looked at the shell. She recognized it too. She had seen it before. She knew who it belonged to.
"Tom, Mia, this shell is not yours. It is not mine. It is not anyone's. It is a shell that belongs to the sea. It is a gift that the sea gives us to enjoy, but not to keep. Do you understand?" she said.
Tom and Mia looked at the shell. They looked at their mom. They looked at each other. They felt sorry for fighting. They nodded.
"Yes, mom, we understand." they said.
Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the shell to hold together.
"Good. Now, why don't you share this nice shell and look for more shells to admire? But remember, when we leave the beach, we have to leave the shells behind. They are not ours to take. They are the sea's to give." she said.
Tom and Mia agreed. They thanked their mom and said sorry to each other. They held the shell and looked at its colors. They felt happy and peaceful. They went back to playing on the beach. They found more shells and made piles of them. They shared them and admired them. They did not fight over them. They had fun.




Ben and Mia were playing in the park with their bikes. They liked to ride fast and make noises. They saw a big hill and wanted to go down it.
"Let's race!" Ben said. "I bet I can go faster than you!"
"OK!" Mia said. "But be careful. There is a cable at the bottom of the hill. It is for the lights. We have to stop before we hit it."
They got ready and started to pedal. They went down the hill very fast. They felt the wind in their hair and the sun on their faces. They laughed and shouted.
But Ben did not listen to Mia. He wanted to win. He did not look at the cable. He did not stop. He hit the cable with his bike. He fell off and hurt his leg. He started to scream.
Mia stopped and ran to him. She saw the blood on his leg. She felt sorry for him. She said, "Ben, why did you not stop? I told you about the cable. You were not wise. You were silly. Now you are hurt."
Ben cried and said, "I'm sorry, Mia. I wanted to win. I did not think. You were wise. You were careful. Can you help me?"
Mia nodded and said, "Yes, I can help you. But first, we have to call Mom. She will know what to do. She will take you to the doctor. He will make your leg better."
She took out her phone and called Mom. She told her what happened. Mom said she would come right away. She told them to stay where they were and not to move.
Mia hugged Ben and said, "Don't worry, Ben. It will be OK. Mom is coming. She will help you. And I will stay with you. You are my brother. I love you."
Ben smiled and said, "Thank you, Mia. You are my sister. I love you too."




Tom was a cat who liked to play outside. He ran, jumped and chased birds and mice. He did not like to take baths or brush his fur. He thought he looked fine with his dirty, tangled coat.
One day, it was very cold and windy. Tom wanted to find a warm place to sleep. He saw a big house with a nice garden. He sneaked in through a hole in the fence. He saw a dog house with a soft blanket inside. He thought it was perfect for him.
He crawled into the dog house and curled up on the blanket. He felt cozy and happy. He did not know that the dog house belonged to Rex, a big, friendly dog who lived in the house.
Soon, Rex came back from his walk with his owner. He smelled a strange scent in his dog house. He barked and ran to see who was there. He saw Tom, the dirty cat, sleeping on his blanket. He was angry and scared.
"Who are you? Get out of my house!" Rex growled.
Tom woke up and saw Rex. He was terrified. He hissed and scratched Rex's nose. He tried to run away, but Rex blocked his way.
"Leave me alone! I just wanted to be warm!" Tom cried.
Rex and Tom fought and made a lot of noise. Their owner heard them and came to see what was wrong. He saw Rex and Tom, both hurt and scared. He picked up Tom and took him inside. He cleaned his wounds and gave him some food and water. He also gave him a bath and brushed his fur. He made him look clean and shiny.
He also checked on Rex and gave him a treat and a hug. He told him he was a good boy for protecting his house. He also told him he was sorry for the cat who was lost and cold.
He put Tom in a cage and called the animal shelter. He hoped they would find a good home for him. He felt sorry for him, but he knew he could not keep him. He already had Rex, who was his best friend.
Tom felt warm and full, but also sad and lonely. He wished he had a friend like Rex. He wished he had taken better care of himself. He realized he had been selfish and rude. He shivered in his cage and licked his paw. He hoped someone would love him and teach him how to be a good cat. He learned a hard lesson that day. He learned that being dirty and mean was not fun or smart. He learned that being clean and kind was better for him and others.




Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to look at the sky and see the clouds. They saw many shapes in the clouds. They saw a bunny, a car, a flower and a star.
"Look, Ben, that cloud looks like a bunny!" Anna said, pointing at the sky.
"I see it, Anna, it has long ears and a fluffy tail!" Ben said, smiling.
They looked for more clouds that looked like things they knew. They recognized a car, a flower and a star. They were having fun.
Then they saw a big cloud that looked like nothing. It was just a big, white, fluffy cloud. It covered the sun and made the sky darker.
"What is that cloud, Anna?" Ben asked, feeling scared.
"I don't know, Ben, it is a strange cloud. Maybe it is a monster cloud!" Anna said, feeling scared too.
They hugged each other and wished the cloud would go away. They did not like the strange cloud.
But then the wind blew and the cloud moved. The sun came out again and made the sky bright and blue. The strange cloud was gone.
"Look, Ben, the sky is beautiful again!" Anna said, feeling happy.
"Yes, Anna, it is. And look, there is a rainbow!" Ben said, feeling happy too.
They saw the rainbow with many colors. They recognized red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. They liked the rainbow. It was a beautiful cloud. They smiled and clapped their hands. They were not scared anymore. They were happy.




Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They liked to observe the bugs and the flowers. They saw a big mushroom under a tree. It was brown and round and had spots on it.
"Look, a mushroom!" Lily said. "Can we touch it?"
"I don't know," Ben said. "Maybe it is not good to touch. Mom said some mushrooms are bad."
Lily wanted to touch it anyway. She reached out her hand and poked the mushroom. It felt soft and wet. But then the mushroom broke and fell apart. Lily gasped.
"Oh no!" Ben said. "You broke the mushroom! What if it was someone's home? What if a bug lived there?"
Lily felt sorry. She did not mean to break the mushroom. She did not know it was so fragile. She looked at the pieces of the mushroom on the ground. She saw a small worm crawling out of one of them. She felt even more sorry.
"I'm sorry, worm," she said. "I'm sorry, mushroom. I did not want to hurt you. I was just curious."
Ben saw that Lily was sorry. He hugged her and said, "It's okay, Lily. You did not know. Maybe we can find another mushroom for the worm. Maybe we can help it find a new home."
Lily nodded. She wiped her tears and smiled. She and Ben looked around the garden for another mushroom. They found one that was smaller and white and had no spots. They carefully picked it up and brought it to the worm. They placed it near the broken mushroom and hoped the worm would like it.
"Here you go, worm," Lily said. "This is a new mushroom for you. We hope you are happy. We are sorry for breaking your old mushroom."
The worm wiggled and seemed to say thank you. Lily and Ben felt happy. They learned to be more careful with the things they observe. They also learned to say sorry when they make a mistake. They went back to playing in the garden, but they did not touch any more mushrooms. They just looked at them and admired their colors and shapes.




Lily and Ben liked to play pirates in the garden. They had a big box that was their ship, and a stick that was their sword. They also had a hook that they found in the shed. It was shiny and sharp, and they pretended it was a treasure.
One day, they decided to go on an adventure to find more treasure. They put on their hats and scarves, and took their ship, sword and hook with them. They walked around the garden, looking for clues. They saw a bird, a flower, a rock, but no treasure.
Then, they saw something shiny under a bush. They ran towards it, hoping it was gold or jewels. But when they got closer, they saw it was a frozen pond. It was very cold and slippery, and they could see fish and plants under the ice.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "Maybe there is treasure under the ice!"
"Let's find out!" Ben said. He took the hook and tried to break the ice with it. He hit the ice hard, but it did not crack. He hit it again, and again, but nothing happened.
"Be careful, Ben!" Lily said. "You might fall in!"
Ben did not listen. He wanted to find the treasure. He hit the ice harder and harder, until he made a small hole. He looked inside, and saw something shiny. He reached for it with his hook, but he lost his balance. He slipped and fell into the pond.
Lily screamed. She saw Ben go under the water. She was very scared. She did not know what to do. She wanted to help Ben, but she did not want to fall in too. She looked around, and saw a big stick. She grabbed it, and ran to the pond. She lay down on the ice, and reached for Ben with the stick.
"Ben, Ben, grab the stick!" she shouted. "I'll pull you out!"
Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily.
"Thank you, Lily!" he said. "You saved me!"
"I'm sorry, Ben!" Lily said. "I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure."
Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, "No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend."
They hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy.




Lily and Ben went to the park with Mom. They saw a big pond with many ducks and swans. Lily liked the swans. They were white and graceful. She wanted to feed them some bread.
"Mom, can I give some bread to the swans?" Lily asked.
"Sure, but be careful. Don't go too close to the water. And don't throw the bread too hard. The swans might get scared," Mom said.
Lily nodded and took a piece of bread from Mom. She walked slowly to the edge of the pond. She saw a swan swimming near her. She smiled and tossed the bread gently to the swan. The swan caught the bread and ate it. It looked happy.
"Thank you, swan!" Lily said.
The swan nodded and swam away. Lily looked for another swan to feed. She saw one that was hidden behind some reeds. It was smaller than the other swans. It looked shy.
"Hello, swan! Do you want some bread?" Lily called.
The hidden swan peeked out from the reeds. It saw Lily and the bread. It wanted the bread, but it was afraid of Lily. It stayed behind the reeds.
"Come on, swan! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. I just want to be your friend," Lily said.
She threw the bread closer to the hidden swan. The hidden swan saw the bread. It was hungry. It decided to try the bread. It swam out from the reeds and took the bread. It tasted good.
"Thank you, Lily!" The hidden swan said.
Lily was surprised. She didn't know that swans could talk.
"You're welcome, swan! What's your name?" Lily asked.
"My name is End. I'm the last of my family. The other swans left me because I'm different. I can talk, but they can't," End said.
"That's sad, End. But you're not alone. You have me. I'm your friend. And you're not different. You're special," Lily said.
End smiled. He felt happy. He had a friend.
"Thank you, Lily. You're special too. Can I stay with you?" End asked.
"Of course, End. You can stay with me. Come on, let's go to Mom. She'll like you too," Lily said.
She took End's wing and led him to Mom. Ben saw them and was amazed.
"Wow, Lily! You have a talking swan!" Ben said.
"Yes, Ben. This is End. He's my friend. Can he play with us?" Lily said.
"Sure, Lily. He can play with us. Hi, End. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," Ben said.
"Hi, Ben. Nice to meet you too. You're Lily's brother, right?" End said.
"Yes, I am. You're very smart, End," Ben said.
"Thank you, Ben. You're very kind, Ben," End said.
Mom saw them and was shocked.
"Lily, Ben, what's going on? Who's this swan?" Mom asked.
"Mom, this is End. He's a talking swan. He's my friend. Can he stay with us?" Lily said.
"A talking swan? That's incredible. How did you find him?" Mom asked.
"He was hidden behind some reeds. He was lonely. I gave him some bread. He thanked me. He told me his name. He asked me to be his friend. I said yes. He's very nice, Mom. Please, can he stay with us?" Lily said.
Mom looked at End. He looked at Mom. He nodded.
"Hello, Mom. I'm End. I'm a talking swan. I'm Lily's friend. Can I stay with you?" End said.
Mom was speechless. She didn't know what to say. She looked at Lily and Ben. They looked at Mom. They smiled.
"Please, Mom. Please," they said.
Mom sighed. She smiled too.
"Okay, okay. You can stay with us, End. But only if you promise to be good and not make too much noise. And you have to share the bread with the other swans. Deal?" Mom said.
"Deal, Mom. Thank you, Mom. You're very nice, Mom," End said.
Lily, Ben, and End hugged Mom. They were happy. They had a new friend. A talking swan. His name was End. But his story was just beginning.




Ben and Mia like to play in the big room with many books and papers. They see a big box with a lock on it. They want to know what is inside. They look for a key, but they cannot find one. They see a metal thing that looks like a stick. It is a file. They think it can open the lock.
They take the file and try to put it in the lock. They push and pull, but nothing happens. They hear a loud noise. It is a beep. They look at the box. It has a red light and a number. The number is going down. 10, 9, 8...
They do not know what it means. They are scared. They tremble. They want to run away, but they do not know how. The door is locked too. They scream for help, but no one hears them. The number is going down. 3, 2, 1...
The box explodes. It makes a big fire and a big boom. It hurts Ben and Mia. They fall down and do not get up. The box was dangerous. It was a bomb. Someone put it there to hurt people. Ben and Mia did not know. They just wanted to play. They are gone. The end.




Lily and Ben are playing in the living room. They see a letter on the table. It is for their mom. Lily wants to open it. She is curious.
"Let me see, let me see!" she says. She grabs the letter and tries to tear it.
"No, no, no!" Ben says. He is careful. He knows mom will be angry if they open her letter. He tries to take the letter from Lily.
They pull and tug. The letter rips. They hear a loud noise. It is mom. She is coming.
They hide the letter under the couch. They pretend to play with their toys. Mom enters the room. She smiles.
"Hello, my sweeties. Did you have fun?" she asks.
"Yes, mom. We played nice," Lily says.
"Me too," Ben says.
Mom looks at the table. She sees the envelope. It is empty. She frowns.
"Where is my letter?" she asks.
Lily and Ben look at each other. They are scared. They do not know what to say.
Lily pokes Ben. She whispers in his ear.
"Tell her, tell her!" she says.
Ben pokes Lily back. He whispers in her ear.
"No, you tell her, you tell her!" he says.
Mom hears them. She bends down. She looks under the couch. She sees the letter. It is torn. She sighs.
"Who did this?" she asks.
Lily and Ben look at the floor. They are sorry. They do not want to make mom sad.
They hug mom. They say together.
"We did, mom. We are sorry. We love you."
Mom hugs them back. She is not angry. She loves them too.
She says.
"It's okay, my sweeties. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful with my letters. They are important. They are from grandma. She misses us a lot."
Lily and Ben nod. They promise to be careful. They ask mom to read the letter to them. Mom smiles. She reads the letter. It is from grandma. She says she loves them a lot. She sends them kisses and hugs. Lily and Ben are happy. They send kisses and hugs back to grandma. They thank mom for the letter. They say they miss grandma too. They hope to see her soon.




Ben and Tom are friends. They like to play football in the park. One day, they find a big box near the trees. They open the box and see many things inside. There are books, toys, clothes, and a shiny football.
"Wow, look at this football!" Ben says. "It is new and red. Can we play with it?"
Tom nods. He likes the football too. He takes it out of the box and kicks it to Ben. Ben kicks it back to Tom. They have fun with the football.
But then, a man comes to the park. He looks angry. He sees the box and the football.
"Hey, you kids!" he shouts. "That is my box and my football! Give them back to me!"
Ben and Tom are scared. They do not know the man. They do not want to give back the football.
"But we found them here," Ben says. "They are not yours."
"They are mine!" the man says. "I left them here for a while. They are very useful to me. The football is a gift for my son. The books are for my work. The toys and clothes are for charity. Now, give them back or I will call the police!"
Ben and Tom do not want to make the man more angry. They do not want to go to the police. They decide to give back the football and the box. They are sad. They liked the football.
"Sorry, mister," Tom says. "We did not know. Here is your football and your box."
The man takes the football and the box. He does not say thank you. He walks away.
Ben and Tom look at each other. They are still friends. They do not need the football to play. They can play with other things. They go to the swings and have fun.




Lily likes to run in the park with her dog Spot. Spot is a big dog with black and white fur. He likes to chase balls and birds and Lily. One day, Lily and Spot run to the big tree. Lily sees a hole in the tree. She wants to look inside.
Lily puts her hand in the hole. She feels something hard and sharp. It hurts her hand. She pulls her hand out. She sees a nail in the hole. The nail is dry and rusty. Lily cries. Spot barks. He wants to help Lily.
Lily's mom hears Lily and Spot. She runs to the big tree. She sees Lily's hand. She sees the nail. She hugs Lily and says, "Don't worry, my sweet. I will make it better." She takes Lily and Spot to the car. She drives to the doctor. The doctor cleans Lily's hand and puts a band-aid on it. He gives Lily a sticker and a lollipop. He says, "You are very brave, Lily. The nail can't hurt you anymore."
Lily smiles. She says, "Thank you, doctor. Thank you, mom. Thank you, Spot." She hugs them all. She feels better. She still likes to run in the park with her dog Spot. But she doesn't put her hand in the hole anymore. She knows the nail is there. She knows it is dry and sharp. She knows it is not a toy.




Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. Lily had a big tank that could shoot balls and make noises. Tom had a small car that could go fast and beep. Lily liked her tank very much and did not want to share it with Tom. Tom liked the tank too and wanted to try it.
"Can I play with your tank, Lily?" Tom asked.
"No, it is mine. You have your car," Lily said.
"But your tank is so cool. Please, let me have a turn," Tom begged.
"No, go away. You are annoying," Lily said.
Tom felt sad and angry. He wanted to make Lily share. He had an idea. He took his car and drove it towards the tank. He bumped the tank hard and made it fall over. The balls flew out of the tank and rolled everywhere. The tank stopped making noises.
"Hey, what are you doing? You broke my tank!" Lily shouted.
"I wanted to play with it. You are mean," Tom said.
Lily was very mad. She grabbed her tank and threw it at Tom. The tank hit Tom on the head and made him cry. Tom dropped his car and held his head.
"Ow, that hurt. You are meaner," Tom said.
Lily and Tom started to yell at each other. They did not see their mom coming into the living room. She saw the mess and the tears and the toys.
"What is going on here? Why are you fighting?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom stopped yelling and looked at Mom. They felt scared and sorry.
"We were playing with the tank and the car and we had a fight," Lily said.
"We both wanted the tank and we broke it and we threw it and we hurt each other," Tom said.
Mom sighed and shook her head. She picked up the tank and the car and put them on the table. She took a cloth and wiped the tears and the dirt from Lily and Tom's faces.
"You two need to learn how to share and be humble. The tank and the car are just toys. They are not worth hurting each other. You are brother and sister. You should love and help each other," Mom said.
Lily and Tom looked at each other. They felt ashamed and sorry.
"We are sorry, Mom. We are sorry, Lily. We are sorry, Tom," they said.
Mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them each a kiss and a cookie.
"That's better. Now, why don't you play something else together? Something nice and fun," Mom said.
Lily and Tom nodded and smiled. They took their cookies and went to their room. They decided to play with their blocks and make a castle. They shared and helped and had fun. They did not fight anymore. They were happy.




Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they find a big box under a tree. They think it is a treasure.
"Wow, look at this!" Sara says. "Maybe there are toys or candy inside!"
"Let's open it!" Ben says. He tries to lift the lid, but it is too heavy. He asks Sara to help him.
They push and pull, but the box does not move. They are sad. They want to see the treasure.
Then, a tall man comes to the tree. He has a hat and a coat. He sees the box and the children.
"Hey, what are you doing?" he says. He sounds angry. "This is my box! Go away!"
Sara and Ben are scared. They do not know the man. They do not want to make him mad.
"But we found it first!" Sara says. "We want to see the treasure!"
"There is no treasure!" the man says. "This is just a box of old books! They are mine! Now leave!"
He grabs the box and walks away. He does not look at the children. He does not say sorry.
Sara and Ben frown. They are not happy. They think the man is mean. They wish they could see the treasure.
They go to the swings and try to forget the box. They hope to find a real treasure someday.




Anna and Ben like to play with crayons. They have many colors and they make marks on paper. Sometimes they make marks on the wall too, but Mommy does not like that. She says it is not polite to make marks on the wall.
One day, Anna and Ben are playing with crayons in their room. Anna wants to make a mark on the wall. She thinks it will be fun. She takes a red crayon and strikes the wall hard. She makes a big mark. She smiles and says, "Look, Ben! I made a mark on the wall!"
Ben sees the mark and he is scared. He knows Mommy will be angry. He says, "No, Anna! That is bad! Mommy will be mad! You should not make marks on the wall!"
Anna does not listen to Ben. She thinks he is silly. She says, "It is not bad. It is pretty. I like to make marks on the wall. You can make one too. Here, take a blue crayon and strike the wall."
Ben does not want to make a mark on the wall. He wants to be polite. He says, "No, thank you. I do not want to make a mark on the wall. I want to make marks on paper. That is polite. Mommy likes that."
Anna gets angry. She says, "You are no fun. You are boring. I do not want to play with you. Go away!"
Ben feels sad. He does not want to fight with Anna. He loves his sister. He says, "I am sorry, Anna. I do not want to go away. I want to play with you. But please do not make marks on the wall. Mommy will be sad. And we will be in trouble."
Anna thinks for a moment. She looks at the mark on the wall. She looks at Ben. She looks at the crayons. She says, "You are right, Ben. I am sorry too. I do not want to make Mommy sad. I do not want to be in trouble. I want to be polite. Let us make marks on paper. That is fun too."
Ben smiles. He says, "OK, Anna. Let us make marks on paper. We can make many colors and shapes. We can make a picture for Mommy. She will be happy."
Anna and Ben hug. They take their crayons and paper. They make marks on paper. They make a picture for Mommy. They are polite. They are happy.




Lily liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes. She painted flowers and animals and houses. She made a big mess on the table and the floor. But she did not care. She was happy.
One day, she painted a picture for her grandma. She painted a big heart and wrote "I love you" with red paint. She was very proud of her picture. She wanted to send it to her grandma. She asked her mom for help.
"Mom, can you help me send this picture to grandma?" she said.
"Sure, Lily. That is a very nice picture. Grandma will love it. But first, we need to clean up your mess. Look at all the paint on the table and the floor. We need to be organized and tidy," her mom said.
"Okay, mom. I will help you. But can we send the picture today?" Lily said.
"Yes, we can. After we clean up, we will put the picture in an envelope and write grandma's address. Then we will go to the post office and mail it. Grandma will get it in a few days," her mom said.
Lily nodded. She was excited. She hoped grandma would like her picture. She helped her mom clean up the paint. She was organized and tidy. She put her colors and brushes in a box. She wiped the table and the floor with a cloth. She thanked her mom for helping her. Then they went to the post office and mailed the picture. Lily smiled. She loved her grandma. She could not wait to hear from her.




Lily and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a lot of fun making a big castle with blocks, cars, dolls and animals. They used glue to stick some parts together, so the castle would not fall down.
"Look, this is the king and the queen, and this is their baby princess," Lily said, showing Tom her dolls. "They live in the castle and they are very happy."
"That's nice, Lily," Tom said, nodding. "And this is the dragon, he is very big and strong. He protects the castle from bad guys. He can breathe fire and fly in the sky."
"Wow, Tom, your dragon is cool," Lily said, admiring his toy. "Can he be friends with the king and the queen?"
"Sure, he can," Tom said, smiling. "He is a good dragon, not a mean one. He likes the castle and the people in it."
They played for a while, making up stories and sounds for their toys. They were having a lot of fun, until they heard a loud noise from the kitchen.
"What was that?" Lily asked, scared.
"I don't know, let's go see," Tom said, curious.
They left their toys on the floor and ran to the kitchen. There they saw their big brother Sam, who had knocked over a jar of cookies and made a mess.
"Sam, what are you doing?" Lily asked, angry.
"I was hungry, and I wanted a cookie," Sam said, shrugging. "But the jar was too high, and I dropped it."
"You are so clumsy, Sam," Tom said, shaking his head. "You broke the jar and the cookies. Mom will be mad at you."
Sam looked at the broken jar and the crumbs on the floor. He felt bad and sorry. He didn't mean to make a mess. He wished he could fix it.
"Maybe we can help you, Sam," Lily said, kindly. "We have glue, we can glue the jar back together."
"Really? You would do that for me?" Sam asked, surprised.
"Sure, we would," Tom said, nodding. "You are our brother, and we love you. And glue is important, it can fix things."
They ran back to the living room and got the glue. They carefully glued the pieces of the jar together, and put the cookies back inside. They were very proud of their work.
"Thank you, Lily and Tom," Sam said, hugging them. "You are the best. You saved me from trouble."
"You're welcome, Sam," Lily and Tom said, smiling. "But next time, ask mom for a cookie, okay?"
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And next time, can I play with you and your castle?"
"Okay, you can," Lily and Tom said, nodding. "But you have to be careful, and not break anything."
"Okay, I will," Sam said, nodding. "And I will protect the castle with you and your dragon."
They all laughed and hugged. They were happy and glad. They were a family, and they stuck together. Just like glue.




Lily and Tom were going to the park with Mom. They liked the park. They could play on the swings, slide down the slide, and run on the grass. They were very happy.
But on the way, they saw a cat. The cat was on the road. It looked scared and hurt. It had a cut on its leg. Lily and Tom felt sorry for the cat. They wanted to help it.
"Mom, can we stop and help the cat?" Lily asked.
"Of course, dear. We can delay going to the park for a little while. The cat needs our help. You are very compassionate, Lily and Tom," Mom said.
Mom parked the car and got out. She took a blanket and a bottle of water from the trunk. She gently wrapped the cat in the blanket and gave it some water. The cat purred and licked Mom's hand.
"Thank you, Mom. You are very kind," the cat seemed to say.
Lily and Tom smiled. They were glad the cat was feeling better. They petted the cat and talked to it softly.
"Can we take the cat home, Mom?" Tom asked.
"Well, we have to find out if the cat has a home already. Maybe it has a collar or a tag with its name and address. If not, we can take it to the vet and see if they can find its owner. If no one claims the cat, then maybe we can adopt it. How does that sound?" Mom asked.
Lily and Tom nodded. They liked that idea. They hoped the cat would be their new friend.
They got back in the car and drove to the vet. They did not mind delaying going to the park. They had found a better way to spend their day. They had shown compassion to a cat in need. And they had learned a valuable lesson. Sometimes, helping others is more fun than playing.




Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside when it is sunny. But today it is rainy and they have to stay inside. They are very bored.
They look at the window and see a big puddle. They want to jump in the puddle and splash. They ask their mom if they can go outside. Mom says no, it is too wet and cold. They have to wait until the rain stops.
Anna and Ben are sad and angry. They think mom is mean. They look for something fun to do inside. They find an umbrella in the closet. They open the umbrella and pretend it is a tent. They crawl under the umbrella and make funny noises.
Mom hears the noises and comes to see what they are doing. She sees the umbrella on the floor and the twins under it. She smiles and says they are very clever. She asks if they want to play a game with her. They say yes, they want to play.
Mom takes the umbrella and holds it over her head. She says she is a giant and they are tiny ants. She pretends to chase them around the room. They run and hide and laugh. They wave at mom and she waves back. They have fun and forget about the rain. They are not bored anymore.




Lily and Ben were very happy. They were going to the park with Mom and Dad. They liked to play on the swings, the slide and the sandbox. They also liked to see the animals in the pond. There were ducks, fish and turtles. Sometimes they fed them bread crumbs.
"Look, Mom, look!" Lily shouted. "There is a big white truck. What is it?"
Mom smiled. "That is an ice cream truck, Lily. It sells cold and sweet treats. Do you want some?"
"Yes, yes, please!" Lily and Ben said. They ran to the truck with Mom and Dad. They heard a funny song from the truck. It made them laugh.
The ice cream man was very nice. He had a big hat and a big smile. He showed them different kinds of ice cream. There were cones, cups, bars and popsicles. There were many colors and flavors.
"What do you want, Lily?" Mom asked.
"I want a pink cone with sprinkles, please," Lily said.
"And you, Ben?" Dad asked.
"I want a blue bar with chocolate, please," Ben said.
The ice cream man gave them their ice cream. They paid him with coins. They thanked him and walked away.
They found a bench to sit and eat their ice cream. They licked and bit their ice cream. It was cold and sweet. They were very happy.
But then they saw something. It was a big black dog. It was running towards them. It had a long tongue and sharp teeth. It looked hungry and angry.
Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped their ice cream. They hugged Mom and Dad.
"Help, help!" they cried. "The dog is coming!"
Mom and Dad were calm. They did not move. They did not scream. They waited for the dog to arrive.
The dog arrived. It sniffed their ice cream. It licked their ice cream. It ate their ice cream. It wagged its tail. It looked happy and friendly.
"See, Lily and Ben, the dog is harmless," Mom said. "It just wanted some ice cream. It did not want to hurt you."
Lily and Ben looked at the dog. They saw that it was harmless. They felt sorry for their ice cream. They felt sorry for the dog.
"Can we give the dog some more ice cream, Mom?" Lily asked.
"Can we pet the dog, Dad?" Ben asked.
Mom and Dad nodded. They smiled. They walked to the ice cream truck with Lily and Ben. They bought some more ice cream. They gave some to the dog. They petted the dog. The dog licked their hands. It made them laugh.
They made a new friend. They were very happy.




Tom and Anna were bored. They wanted to play catch, but it was raining outside. They looked around the house for something to do.
"Let's play catch in the kitchen!" Tom said. He saw a big ball on the floor.
"OK!" Anna said. She liked to play catch. She followed Tom to the kitchen.
They threw the ball to each other. They were careful not to hit anything. They had fun.
But then, Tom threw the ball too hard. It flew past Anna and hit the refrigerator. The refrigerator door opened. A lot of food and drinks fell out. Some of them broke and spilled on the floor.
"Oh no!" Tom and Anna said. They were scared. They heard their mom coming.
"What is this mess?" their mom said. She was angry. She saw the ball, the food, and the drinks. She saw Tom and Anna.
"Tom and Anna, you are in big trouble!" she said. "You should not play catch in the kitchen. You should be quiet and careful. You wasted a lot of food and drinks. You have to clean this up and go to your rooms. No more playing for today!"
Tom and Anna felt bad. They said sorry to their mom. They helped her clean the kitchen. Then they went to their rooms. They were sad. They wished they had played catch outside.




Tommy was very happy. His birthday was soon. He wanted to invite his friends to his party. He asked his mom for help.
"Mom, can I invite Sam and Lily and Ben and Anna to my party?" he said.
"Of course, my dear. You can invite whoever you want. It's your special day," his mom said.
"Can I invite Aunt Lucy too?" he said.
His mom frowned. She did not like Aunt Lucy. Aunt Lucy was ignorant. She always said mean things to Tommy and his mom. She did not know how to be nice.
"Tommy, I don't think Aunt Lucy would enjoy your party. She doesn't like fun things. She likes to sit and complain. She might make you and your friends unhappy," his mom said.
"But she is my aunt. She is family. Maybe she will be happy if I invite her. Maybe she will be nice to me," Tommy said.
His mom sighed. She loved Tommy very much. She wanted him to be happy. She did not want to hurt his feelings.
"Okay, Tommy. If you really want to invite Aunt Lucy, you can. But don't be sad if she doesn't come or if she is rude. You have many other people who love you and who will celebrate with you," his mom said.
Tommy smiled. He hugged his mom. He was excited for his party. He hoped Aunt Lucy would come and be nice. He hoped she would learn how to have fun. He hoped she would not be ignorant anymore.




Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat dinner. Mommy was cooking in the kitchen. She had a big pot of water on the stove. She put some potatoes in the water. She said, "The potatoes will be soft and yummy soon. But don't touch the pot. It is very hot and dangerous. You can get hurt."
Lily and Tom nodded. They played with their toys in the living room. They waited for the potatoes to be ready. They smelled something good. They heard Mommy say, "Dinner is ready. Come and eat."
Lily and Tom ran to the kitchen. They saw Mommy put some potatoes on their plates. She also gave them some cheese and broccoli. They said, "Thank you, Mommy. This looks delicious."

Sara liked to help her mom in the kitchen. She liked to stir the soup, cut the bread, and taste the cheese. But she did not like onions. Onions made her cry and smell bad. She always tried to hide them under her plate or give them to the dog.
One day, mom asked Sara to spend some time with her dad in the garden. She said they had to pick some onions for dinner. Sara did not want to go, but she did not want to make mom sad. She put on her boots and hat and followed dad outside.
The garden was huge. There were many plants and flowers and bugs. Sara liked to look at them and touch them. But she did not like the onions. They were big and round and had long green hair. Dad said they were good for the soup and the salad and the meat. He gave Sara a basket and a knife and told her to cut some onions.
Sara did not want to cut the onions. She wanted to play with the bugs and the flowers. She looked around and saw a butterfly. It was yellow and black and very pretty. She ran after it, leaving the basket and the knife behind.
Dad did not see Sara run away. He was busy cutting onions. He filled the basket with many onions. He was proud of his work. He wanted to show mom and Sara how many onions he had. He picked up the basket and the knife and walked back to the house.
Sara followed the butterfly to the other side of the garden. She saw a big tree with red apples. She liked apples. They were sweet and juicy and crunchy. She wanted to have one. She climbed the tree and reached for an apple.
But she did not see the bee. The bee was on the apple. It was angry and scared. It did not like Sara. It stung Sara on the nose. Sara screamed and fell from the tree. She dropped the apple and the butterfly flew away.
Dad heard Sara scream. He dropped the basket and the knife and ran to Sara. He saw her on the ground, crying and holding her nose. He saw the bee and the apple and the tree. He understood what happened. He felt sorry for Sara. He hugged her and kissed her and said:
"It's okay, Sara. It's just a bee sting. It will go away soon. You are brave and strong. I love you, Sara."
Sara looked at dad. She saw his eyes and his smile and his beard. She smelled his breath and his shirt and his hair. She smelled the onions. She did not like the onions. But she liked dad. She loved dad. She said:
"I love you too, dad. But I don't like onions."

Sara and Ben were playing with bubbles in the park. They had a big bottle of soap and a wand. They blew bubbles and watched them fly in the air. They laughed and clapped when the bubbles popped.
"Look, Sara, I made a big bubble!" Ben said. He held the wand up and showed Sara a huge bubble. It was shiny and round.
"Wow, Ben, that's a great bubble!" Sara said. She was proud of her brother. He was good at making bubbles.
But then a mean boy came and saw the bubble. He wanted the bubble for himself. He ran to Ben and grabbed the wand.
"Give me that! I want the bubble!" he demanded. He tried to pull the wand from Ben's hand.
"No, it's mine! Go away!" Ben said. He held on to the wand. He did not want to share with the mean boy.
"Stop it! You are being rude!" Sara said. She came to help Ben. She pushed the mean boy away.

Lily makes a pretend cake and tea with her blocks and cups. She sets them on a small table next to her bed. She invites Anna and her other dolls to have a tea party. She gives each doll a cup and a plate. She says, "This is a very special tea party. Anna has a fancy spoon that she owns. She can share it with you if she wants."
The other dolls are happy to see Anna's spoon. They say, "Wow, Anna, your spoon is so shiny and pretty. Can we see it? Can we try it?" Anna is very kind and lets the other dolls use her spoon. She says, "Thank you for coming to my tea party. You are my friends. You can use my spoon, but please be careful. It is very important to me."
Lily smiles and claps her hands. She is proud of Anna and her spoon. She thinks Anna is the best doll in the world. She says, "I love you, Anna. You are a very nice princess. You have a fancy spoon that you own, but you also share it with your friends. You make me happy."




Tommy likes to play with his rubber ball. He can bounce it, throw it, and catch it. He has fun with his ball every day.
One day, Tommy wants to try something new. He sees a big hill near his house. He thinks it would be fun to roll his ball down the hill and see how far it goes. He runs to the hill with his ball.
He puts his ball on the top of the hill and gives it a push. The ball starts to roll down the hill very fast. Tommy runs after it, but he cannot catch it. The ball goes faster and faster, and Tommy gets tired.
The ball reaches the bottom of the hill and keeps rolling. It rolls into a pond. The pond is cold and deep. Tommy stops at the edge of the pond and looks at his ball. He is sad. He cannot get his ball back.

Sam and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to ride their bikes on the paths and go down the slides. They wore helmets to keep their heads safe. They were lively and happy.
"Look, Mia, a big hill!" Sam said. "Let's go up and see what's on the other side."
"OK, Sam, but be careful!" Mia said. "The hill is steep and bumpy."
They pedaled hard and reached the top of the hill. They saw a pond with ducks and a bridge. They also saw a sign that said "No bikes allowed".
"Wow, this is pretty!" Mia said. "But we can't go on the bridge with our bikes. What should we do?"
"Let's settle our bikes here and walk across the bridge," Sam said. "We can come back for them later."
They got off their bikes and left them by the sign. They took off their helmets and held them in their hands. They walked across the bridge and fed the ducks some bread. They had fun watching the ducks swim and quack.

But when they got there, they saw a long line of kids. They had to wait for their turn. Lily and Max were anxious. They wanted to slide now.

He had lost his friend and his trust. He had to face the consequences. He had a bad ending.




Tommy was miserable. He had a cold and his nose was runny. He could not play with his toys or watch his favorite show. He only wanted to sleep, but he could not. He heard loud noises outside his window. He looked and saw big trucks and cars zooming by. They made a lot of speed and noise. Tommy hated them. They kept him awake.
"Mommy, make them stop!" he cried. He pulled his blanket over his head.
Mommy came to his room and hugged him. She felt his forehead and gave him some medicine. She said, "I'm sorry, Tommy. They are fixing the road. They have to work fast. They will be done soon. Then it will be quiet."
"But I want to sleep now!" Tommy whined. He sniffled and coughed.
Mommy smiled and kissed him. She said, "I know, honey. How about I read you a story? Maybe that will help you relax and fall asleep."
Tommy nodded. He liked stories. Mommy picked up a book and sat on his bed. She read him a story about a brave knight and a friendly dragon. Tommy listened and imagined the adventure. He forgot about the noise and the cold. He felt warm and cozy. He closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep. Mommy tucked him in and turned off the light. She whispered, "Good night, Tommy. I love you."
The end.

The path led them to a cliff. It was very high and steep, and they could see the river and the bridge far below. Tom and Sue were amazed by the view. They wanted to see more, so they walked closer to the edge of the cliff.
"Look, Mom, look!" Tom shouted. "I can see a boat and a fish and a duck!"
"Be careful, Tom, don't go too close!" Mom warned. "The cliff might break and you might fall!"
But Tom did not listen. He took one more step, and then he heard a loud crack. The ground under his feet broke, and he started to slide down the cliff. He screamed and reached for Mom.
Mom was quick and brave. She grabbed Tom's hand and pulled him back to safety. She hugged him and scolded him. "Tom, you were very naughty and foolish! You could have hurt yourself or worse! You have to listen to me and follow the rules!"
Tom was scared and sorry. He cried and said, "I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry! I won't do it again, I promise!"
Sue was also scared and sorry. She hugged Tom and said, "I'm sorry, too, Mom. I should have stopped Tom. I love you, Tom, and I don't want you to get hurt!"
Mom was relieved and glad. She hugged them both and said, "I love you, too, Tom and Sue. I'm happy you're both safe and sound. But you have to be more careful and sensible next time. Now let's go back to the park and have some fun!"




Tim and Kim are twins. They like to play and eat. One day, they see a big jar of butter in the kitchen. They love butter on their bread.
"Let's take some butter," Tim says. "Mom won't know."
"OK," Kim says. "But how do we get it?"
Tim has a creative idea. He gets a chair and a spoon. He climbs on the chair and reaches for the jar. He scoops some butter with the spoon and puts it in his pocket.
"Good job, Tim," Kim says. "Now it's my turn."
She gets another spoon and climbs on the chair. She also scoops some butter and puts it in her pocket.
They are very happy. They run to their room with their butter. They find some bread and make butter sandwiches. They eat and smile.
But they don't know that Mom is watching. She sees them steal the butter. She is not happy. She goes to their room and knocks on the door.
"Tim and Kim, what are you doing?" she asks.
They look at Mom. They see her angry face. They feel bad.
"We are sorry, Mom," they say. "We took some butter. We were hungry."
Mom sighs. She knows they like butter. But she also knows they should not steal.
"Tim and Kim, stealing is wrong," she says. "You should ask me first. And you should not put butter in your pocket. It will make a mess."
She shows them their pockets. They are full of melted butter. It drips on the floor.
They see their pockets. They are shocked. They did not think of that.
"Oops," they say.
Mom shakes her head. She makes them clean their pockets and the floor. She also makes them share the rest of the butter with their brother and sister.
They learn their lesson. They do not steal butter again. They ask Mom first. And they use a plate.




Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big pile of snow in the park. They ran to the snow and started to make a snowman.
"Let's make him a hat and a scarf," Lila said. "And a nose and eyes and a mouth."
"OK," Ben said. "I have a hat and a scarf in my bag. And I have some buttons and a carrot."
They put the hat and the scarf on the snowman's head and neck. They used the buttons for the eyes and the mouth. They used the carrot for the nose.
"Look, he is so cute!" Lila said. "But he needs something else. Something orange."
"Like what?" Ben asked.
"Like this!" Lila said. She picked up an orange from her bag and threw it at the snowman.
"Hey, don't do that!" Ben said. "That's not nice. That's my orange. I was going to eat it."
But it was too late. The orange hit the snowman and broke into pieces. The pieces fell on the snow and made it look dirty.
"Oops," Lila said. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make a mess. I just wanted to make him more colorful."
"Well, you didn't," Ben said. "You made him worse. And you wasted my orange. That was not a good thing to do."
Lila felt bad. She realized she had been selfish and rude. She wanted to make it up to Ben.
"I'm sorry, Ben," she said. "I was wrong. I should have asked you first. And I should have been more careful. Can you forgive me?"
Ben looked at Lila. He saw that she was sincere and sorry. He decided to be kind and forgiving.
"It's OK, Lila," he said. "I forgive you. But next time, please think before you act. And don't throw things at people or things. That can hurt them or ruin them."
Lila nodded. She learned her lesson. She hugged Ben and said, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. And so is our snowman. Even if he is not orange."
They smiled and played with the snowman. They made him an icy heart and gave him a hug. They hoped he would stay for a long time. They were happy.

One day, he went to the park with his mom and saw a big slide. He ran to the slide and pushed the other kids away. He shouted, "I want to go first! Move, move, move!" The other kids were scared and angry, but they moved away. Tom climbed up the ladder and sat on the top of the slide. He felt very proud and happy.
But then, he heard a loud noise. It was a dog barking. Tom looked down and saw a big, black dog at the bottom of the slide. The dog was wagging its tail and jumping up and down. It wanted to play with Tom. Tom was afraid of dogs. He did not like their teeth and their fur and their noise. He screamed, "Go away, go away, go away!"
The dog did not go away. It thought Tom was playing with it. It barked louder and jumped higher. Tom was stuck on the slide. He could not go down or up. He cried and cried. He wished he had not pushed the other kids away. He wished he had not been so rude and bossy.
His mom heard him crying and came to help him. She shooed the dog away and hugged Tom. She said, "It's okay, Tom. The dog was just friendly. He did not want to hurt you. But you should not demand things from others. You should be kind and polite and share. That's how you make friends and have fun. Do you understand?"
Tom nodded and said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, kids. I was wrong. Can I play with you?" The other kids saw that Tom was embarrassed and sorry. They forgave him and let him join them. Tom learned his lesson and played nicely with the other kids. He had more fun than ever. He did not demand things anymore. He said, "Please" and "Thank you" and "Sorry". He was a good boy.




Tom and Lily were twins who liked to play in the farm. They saw many animals and plants there. They liked to feed the chickens and pet the cows. But their favorite thing was to play with the pumpkins.
The pumpkins were big and round and orange. They grew in a patch near the barn. Tom and Lily liked to roll them and stack them and make faces on them. But they also liked to throw them.
One day, they found a very big pumpkin in the patch. It was bigger than their heads. They wanted to see how far they could throw it. They lifted it together and carried it to the hill. They counted to three and threw it as hard as they could.
But they were careless. They did not see where the pumpkin was going. They did not see the farmer's truck parked at the bottom of the hill. They did not hear the crash and the smash and the honk.
The farmer was angry. He saw his truck with a big dent and a broken window. He saw the pumpkin splattered all over the ground. He saw Tom and Lily hiding behind a bush. He shouted at them and told them to come out.
Tom and Lily were scared. They knew they did a bad thing. They said they were sorry and they did not mean to hurt the truck. They said they just wanted to have fun with the pumpkin.
The farmer was still angry, but he was also kind. He saw that Tom and Lily were young and did not know better. He told them to help him clean up the mess and to be more careful next time. He told them to never throw pumpkins again.
Tom and Lily nodded and did what the farmer said. They learned their lesson. They still liked to play with the pumpkins, but they did not throw them anymore. They were more careful and respectful. They were happy and so was the farmer.

"Can I borrow your kite?" Ben asks Anna. He wants to fly the kite in the sky.

Anna watches Ben from the bench. She sees the kite fly high and far. She sees the string get smaller and smaller. She feels sad. She misses her kite.
"Ben, come back!" Anna calls. "It is time to go home. Give me back my kite."
But Ben does not hear Anna. He is too busy with the kite. He does not see how distant the kite is. He does not notice that the string is loose. He does not feel the string slip from his hand.
The kite flies away. The string falls to the ground. Ben looks up and sees nothing. He feels sad. He lost the kite.
"Anna, I am sorry," Ben says. He runs to Anna with the string. "I did not mean to lose your kite. It was an accident."
Anna is angry. She does not want the string. She wants her kite. She does not forgive Ben. She does not want to be his friend.
They go home. They do not talk to each other. They do not play with toys and books. They are lonely and unhappy. They wish they had their kite and their friend.

"Okay, here's one," the man said. "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

"Because he wanted to go to the other side?" Ben said.
"Because he was hungry?" Lily said.

"It will bloom. That means it will open and show its pretty petals. Like this one." Sara points to a blooming flower.

Lily was a little girl who liked to wear dresses. She had many dresses of different colors and patterns. She liked to wear them when she played with her dolls or her friends.
One day, she wanted to wear her pink dress with flowers. She looked for it in her closet, but she could not find it. She asked her mom, "Mom, where is my pink dress?"
Her mom said, "I'm sorry, Lily, but your pink dress is dirty. You spilled juice on it yesterday. I have to wash it."
Lily was sad. She did not want to wear another dress. She said, "But I love my pink dress. It is my favorite. I want to wear it now."
Her mom said, "I know, Lily, but you have to wait until it is clean. Why don't you wear your blue dress with stars? It is also very pretty."
Lily did not like her blue dress. She thought it was too dark and boring. She said, "No, I don't like my blue dress. It is not pretty. It is dark and ugly."
Her mom said, "Lily, that is not nice. Your blue dress is not ugly. It is dark, but it has bright stars on it. It is like the night sky. And you know what? You have a star on your tooth."
Lily was surprised. She touched her tooth with her tongue. She felt a little bump. She said, "A star on my tooth? What do you mean?"
Her mom said, "Yes, a star on your tooth. You have a loose tooth, Lily. It is wiggling. Soon, it will fall out. And then, you will get a new tooth. And a visit from the tooth fairy."
Lily was excited. She ran to the mirror and looked at her tooth. She saw that it was a little bit lower than the other teeth. She wiggled it with her finger. She said, "Wow, I have a loose tooth. It is like a star. It is shiny and special."
Her mom said, "Yes, it is. And you know what? The tooth fairy likes stars. She likes to collect them from children who lose their teeth. She gives them a coin or a gift in exchange. But she only comes at night, when it is dark."
Lily thought about it. She said, "So, if I wear my blue dress with stars, the tooth fairy will like it? She will think I am a star too?"
Her mom said, "Maybe. She might. She likes children who are brave and kind and happy. And who take good care of their teeth. Do you want to try?"
Lily nodded. She said, "Yes, I want to try. I want to meet the tooth fairy. I want to give her my star tooth. And I want to see what she gives me. Maybe another dress?"
Her mom smiled. She said, "Maybe. You never know. But first, you have to wear your blue dress. And brush your teeth. And go to bed. And sleep. Can you do that?"
Lily said, "Yes, I can. I will wear my blue dress. And brush my teeth. And go to bed. And sleep. And dream of stars. And the tooth fairy."
She hugged her mom. She said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you."
Her mom said, "I love you too, Lily. You are my star."

"Wow, Tom, it's so pretty! Can I see?" Lily said, running over to him.
They took turns looking at the shell and listening to the sound inside. They wondered if there was a sea creature living in it.
They decided to put the shell in their bucket with the other things they found. They were having so much fun, they didn't notice the sky getting dark and the wind getting strong.

"Ha ha, I look funny. How do I look, Ben?"
Ben laughs too. He thinks Anna looks silly. He takes a picture of her with his toy camera.
"You look like a clown, Anna. Cheese!"
Anna and Ben hear a voice. It is a man. He is wearing a white coat and glasses. He is holding a clipboard and a pen.
"Excuse me, children. That is my hat. I need it for my test," the man says.
"Your test? What test?" Anna asks.
The man smiles. He points to a big balloon. The balloon is green and has a number on it. It is tied to a string.
"I am testing how high the balloon can fly. The hat has a device that can measure the height. See this button?" the man says.
He shows Anna and Ben a small button on the hat. He presses it. The balloon starts to rise in the air.
"Wow, that is cool!" Ben says.
"Can we watch?" Anna asks.
"Sure, you can watch. But please give me back my hat. I need to record the data," the man says.
Anna takes off the hat. She gives it to the man. She is sorry to lose the pretty hat, but she is curious about the balloon.
"Thank you, children. You are very nice. Do you want a reward?" the man asks.
He opens his coat. He has a pocket full of candies. The candies are colorful and shiny. They look yummy.
"Yes, please!" Anna and Ben say.
The man gives them each a candy. They unwrap it and put it in their mouths. It is sweet and chewy.
"Mmm, this is yummy!" Anna says.
"Thank you, mister. You are very nice too," Ben says.
The man smiles. He puts the hat on his head. He watches the balloon fly higher and higher. He writes something on his clipboard.
Anna and Ben watch too. They hold their candies and their hands. They are happy. They have made a new friend. And they have learned something new.




Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and cars. But today they have a test at school. The test is about colors and shapes. Lily and Ben want to do well on the test.
Before the test, they look at their books. Lily sees a red circle. She says, "This is a red circle. I know it." Ben sees a blue square. He says, "This is a blue square. I know it." They are happy.
But then they see a yellow triangle. Lily says, "This is a yellow circle. I know it." Ben says, "No, this is a yellow square. I know it." They are not happy. They start to quarrel. They say, "You are wrong. I am right." They are loud and angry.
The teacher hears them. She comes to them. She says, "Stop quarreling. You are both wrong. This is a yellow triangle. It has three sides. A circle has no sides. A square has four sides. Can you see the difference?" Lily and Ben look at the yellow triangle. They see the difference. They feel silly. They say, "Sorry, teacher. Sorry, friend. We were wrong. We will not quarrel again." The teacher smiles. She says, "Good. Now, let's take the test. It is easy. You can do it."
Lily and Ben take the test. They answer the questions about colors and shapes. They do well on the test. They are happy. They hug each other. They say, "We are friends. We help each other. We learn together." They are peaceful. They play with blocks and cars. They have fun. The end.




Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and sing songs. One day, they find a big box in the attic. Inside the box, there is a player. The player has a round thing that spins and makes music.
"Wow, look at this!" Lily says. "Let's try it!"
They put the round thing on the player and turn it on. The music is loud and fun. Lily and Tom start to dance. They jump and clap and spin. They are happy.
But then, they hear a noise. It is Mom. She is coming up the stairs.
"Oh no, we have to stop!" Tom says. "Mom will be mad. She said we can't play in the attic."
But Lily does not want to stop. She likes the music. She is lazy. She does not listen to Tom.
"Come on, Lily, hurry!" Tom says. He turns off the player and puts the round thing back in the box. He runs to the door.
But Lily stays. She dances by herself. She does not hear Mom.
Mom opens the door. She sees Lily dancing. She is not happy.
"Lily, what are you doing?" Mom says. "You know you are not allowed to play in the attic. And you are making too much noise. You have to come down right now."
Lily stops dancing. She looks at Mom. She is scared. She knows she is in trouble.
"Sorry, Mom," Lily says. "I just wanted to dance."
Mom sighs. She takes Lily by the hand and leads her down the stairs. She is not very mad, but she is disappointed.
"Next time, listen to your friend," Mom says. "And don't be lazy. Dancing is fun, but you have to follow the rules."
Lily nods. She feels sorry. She hopes Mom will forgive her. She hopes Tom will still be her friend. She likes to dance, but she likes to play with Tom more.




Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park every day. They had a lot of fun on the swings, the slide and the seesaw. But their favorite thing was the rope bridge. It was high and long and wobbly. They pretended they were crossing a jungle or a mountain.
One day, they saw a new boy in the park. His name was Max. He looked sad and lonely. Lily and Ben wanted to be nice to him. They asked him if he wanted to play with them. Max nodded and smiled. They showed him the rope bridge and told him it was fun.
But Max was scared of the rope bridge. He thought it was too high and too wobbly. He did not want to cross it. He said he would wait for them on the other side. Lily and Ben said okay and started to cross the rope bridge. They held the rope tight and walked slowly.
But when they were in the middle of the bridge, they heard a loud snap. One of the ropes had broken. The bridge tilted and shook. Lily and Ben screamed. They were afraid they would fall. They looked for Max, but he was not there. He had run away.
Lily and Ben did not know what to do. They were stuck on the bridge. They cried for help. But no one heard them. They wished Max had stayed with them. They wished they had a friend who would not leave them.
Then they saw a man coming. He was wearing a hat and a badge. He was a park ranger. He saw Lily and Ben on the bridge. He ran to help them. He had a big rope. He threw it to them and told them to hold it tight. He pulled them to safety. He hugged them and said they were brave.
Lily and Ben thanked the park ranger. They were happy he had saved them. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that a true friend is someone who remains with you when you need them. They learned that a rope can be tight or loose, but a friendship should always be tight.




Mira was a little bird who liked to fly and sing. She had many friends in the forest, but her best friend was Rani, a big bear. Rani was very kind and reliable. She always helped Mira when she was in trouble, and shared her honey and berries with her.
One day, Mira and Rani were playing near the river, when they heard a loud roar. It was a mean lion who wanted to eat them. Mira and Rani were scared and ran away. The lion chased them through the trees and bushes, but he was not fast enough. Mira and Rani reached a big cave and hid inside.
The lion could not find them, and soon he gave up and left. Mira and Rani were safe, but they were very tired. They decided to sleep in the cave for the night. Mira found a soft spot on the floor and made a nest with some leaves and feathers. Rani curled up next to her and wrapped her arms around her. Mira felt warm and cozy in Rani's hug. She thanked Rani for being her friend and saving her from the lion. Rani smiled and said, "You are welcome, Mira. You are my friend and I will always protect you." They closed their eyes and fell asleep. They dreamed of flying and singing in the forest.




Mia liked to walk by herself. She was a big girl and very independent. She did not need to hold her mom's hand or stay close to her dad. She wanted to explore and see new things.
One day, she saw a bridge over a stream. She wanted to cross the bridge and see what was on the other side. She ran towards the bridge, but she did not see the big rock on the ground. She stumbled and fell. She scraped her knee and started to cry.
Her mom and dad heard her cry and ran to help her. They picked her up and hugged her. They cleaned her knee and put a band-aid on it. They told her they were proud of her for being brave and curious, but they also reminded her to be careful and watch where she was going.
Mia felt better and said sorry for running away. She said she still wanted to cross the bridge, but she would hold her mom's hand this time. Her mom and dad smiled and agreed. They crossed the bridge together and saw some ducks and flowers on the other side. Mia was happy and learned a lesson. She realized that being independent was good, but being safe and loved was better.




Bella loved to bounce on her big red ball. She bounced up and down, left and right, all over the yard. She liked to pretend that she was a rocket, flying to the moon and the stars.
One day, she saw a new boy in the house next door. He had a small blue rocket in his hand. He looked troubled. He did not smile or wave at Bella.
"Hi, I'm Bella," she said, bouncing over to him. "What's your name?"
"Tommy," he said, looking at his rocket. "I just moved here with my mom and dad."
"Do you like rockets?" Bella asked. "I do. I have a big red ball that I bounce like a rocket."
Tommy nodded. "I like rockets too. But mine is broken. It won't fly. It just falls down."
Bella felt sorry for Tommy. She wanted to help him. She had an idea.
"Maybe we can fix your rocket," she said. "Or we can make a new one. We can use some cardboard and tape and paint. And we can bounce on my ball together. It will be fun."
Tommy looked at Bella. He saw her big smile and her bright eyes. He felt a little better. He liked her idea.
"Okay," he said. "Let's try it. Maybe we can be friends."
Bella nodded. She took his hand and led him to her yard. She bounced on her ball and he followed her. They laughed and talked and played. They made a new rocket and bounced it to the sky. They became friends. They were happy.




Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and games, but they also liked to try on their parents' clothes. They thought it was fun to wear big hats and coats and shoes and pretend to be different people.
One day, they found a key on the floor. They wondered what it could unlock. They looked around and saw a big trunk in the corner of the room. They had never opened it before. They decided to try the key on the trunk. It fit and they turned it. The trunk unlocked with a click.
They opened the trunk and saw many unusual clothes inside. They were colorful and shiny and had strange patterns and shapes. They were very different from the clothes they usually wore. They were curious and excited. They took out some of the clothes and put them on. They laughed and danced and made funny noises.
"Look at me, I'm a king!" Tim said, wearing a purple robe and a golden crown.
"And I'm a clown!" Sam said, wearing a red nose and a polka-dot suit.
They had so much fun that they did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to their room and saw them in the unusual clothes. She was surprised and angry.
"Tim and Sam, what are you doing?" she asked. "These are not your clothes. These are your grandparents' clothes. They are very special and old. You should not play with them. You could damage them or lose them. They are part of our family history. You should respect them and put them back in the trunk. And you should not unlock things that are not yours. You should ask permission first. Do you understand?"
Tim and Sam felt ashamed and sorry. They realized they had done something wrong. They took off the unusual clothes and put them back in the trunk. They locked it and gave the key to their mom. They apologized and hugged her.
"We're sorry, mom. We didn't know. We were just curious and wanted to have fun. We won't do it again. We love you and we love our grandparents. Can you tell us more about them and their clothes?" they asked.
Their mom smiled and forgave them. She was glad they learned their lesson. She told them stories about their grandparents and their clothes. She explained why they were unusual and what they meant. She showed them pictures and souvenirs. She said they could look at them again, but only with her. Tim and Sam listened and asked questions. They felt happy and proud to know more about their family. They understood that some things are not for playing, but for remembering and honoring. They thanked their mom and gave her a kiss. They went to have lunch and then played with their own toys and clothes. They still had fun, but they also had respect.




Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big cart with many toys on it. The cart was red and shiny, and it had wheels and a handle. Lily and Ben wanted to play with the toys, so they ran to the cart.
"Look, Ben, there is a doll and a truck and a ball and a book!" Lily said. She gazed at the toys with wide eyes. She reached for the doll, but Ben grabbed it first.
"No, Lily, this is mine!" Ben said. He held the doll close to his chest. He gazed at the truck and wanted it too. He tried to take it from the cart, but Lily stopped him.
"No, Ben, this is mine!" Lily said. She pulled the truck from his hand. She gazed at the ball and wanted it too. She tried to take it from the cart, but Ben stopped her.
They both wanted all the toys, and they started to fight. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They were very upset.
"Hey, hey, stop that!" a voice said. It was the man who owned the cart. He came out of his house and saw the twins fighting over his toys. He was not happy. He gazed at them with a frown.
"These are not your toys, these are mine!" the man said. "I was going to sell them at the market, but you ruined them. Look, the doll is torn and the truck is broken and the ball is dirty and the book is wet. You are very naughty!"
Lily and Ben felt sorry. They did not mean to ruin the toys. They gazed at the man with sad eyes.
"We are sorry, mister," they said. "We just wanted to play. Can we help you fix the toys?"
The man sighed. He gazed at the twins with a soft smile.
"Well, you are sorry, and that is good," he said. "But you should not take things that are not yours. You should ask first. And you should share with each other. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They understood. They helped the man fix the toys. They also learned to share with each other. They gazed at the toys with happy eyes. They thanked the man and went home. They were not upset anymore. They were friends.




Sara and Ben like to play in the park. They have a ball and a bike. They have fun with their friends. One day, they see a big hole in the ground. They want to see what is inside.
They go near the hole and look down. They see something white and hard. It looks like a big stick. But it is not a stick. It is a skeleton. A skeleton is what is inside you when you have no skin or hair or eyes. Sara and Ben are scared. They want to run away.
But they are too late. A big dog comes out of the hole. It is angry and hungry. It has sharp teeth and long claws. It wants to eat Sara and Ben. It jumps on them and bites them. Sara and Ben scream and cry. They have no chance. The dog eats them and their ball and their bike. The dog is happy. Sara and Ben are gone. The end.




Ben and Lily were twins who lived in a big house with their wealthy parents. They had many toys and books and clothes, but they were not happy. They wanted to go outside and play with other children, but their parents said no. They said the air outside was bad and they needed to stay inside and breathe oxygen from a machine.
One day, Ben and Lily saw a bird flying by their window. It was blue and yellow and sang a pretty song. They wondered how the bird could fly in the bad air and why it did not need a machine. They decided to ask their parents.
"Mom, Dad, can we talk to you?" they said.
"What is it, my darlings?" their mom said.
"We saw a bird outside. It was flying and singing. How can it do that?" they asked.
Their dad sighed and said, "The bird is different from us. It has a special body that can filter the bad air and make its own oxygen. We are not so lucky. We need the machine to help us breathe."
"But why is the air bad, Dad?" they asked.
Their mom looked sad and said, "The air is bad because of the people who do not care about the planet. They make too much smoke and trash and noise. They use up all the good things and leave nothing for others. That is why we are wealthy, because we have the good things and they do not."
Ben and Lily did not understand. They did not think the good things made them happy. They thought the bird was happier than them. They wished they could fly and sing and breathe like the bird. They wished they could meet other children who did not need machines. They wished they could see the planet and care about it. They wished they could be different.




Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play with blocks. They could build many things with blocks, like houses, towers, bridges, and cars. They had fun sharing and helping each other.
One day, they found a big box of new blocks in the playroom. They were very happy and wanted to build something big and beautiful. But they had different ideas. Lily wanted to build a castle, and Ben wanted to build a rocket. They argued and fought over the blocks. They did not share or help each other. They tried to build their own things, but they were not happy.
Soon, they saw that their castle and rocket were not good. They were weak and ugly. They fell apart easily. They had used too many blocks for themselves, and not enough for their friend. They felt sad and troubled. They wished they had played nicely.
Then, they had an idea. They said sorry to each other, and decided to work together. They mixed their blocks and their ideas. They used some blocks to build a castle, and some blocks to build a rocket. They shared and helped each other. They made a castle-rocket, that was big and beautiful. It was strong and shiny. It did not fall apart. They were very happy.
They learned that playing together is better than playing alone. They learned that sharing and helping is better than fighting and taking. They learned that building with blocks is fun, but building with friends is more fun. They hugged and smiled. They had a good day today.

Ben sees the cut too. He says, "Don't worry, Sara. I can help. I have a band-aid." He takes a band-aid from his pocket and puts it on the bear's ear. He says, "There, now your bear is better. The band-aid will make the cut go away."
Sara smiles. She says, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You are kind." She hugs Ben and the bear. Ben hugs Sara and the car. They are happy again.

"Look, grapes!" Sara said. "Let's go and get some."
"But they are not ours," Tom said. "Maybe someone else will come back for them."
Sara did not listen. She ran to the table and grabbed a grape. She put it in her mouth. It was sweet and juicy. She was glad.
"Come on, Tom, they are yummy!" Sara said. "No one is here. We can have some more."
Tom was scared. He did not want to take what was not his. He looked around. He saw a man walking towards the table. He had a big hat and a big bag. He looked angry.
"Uh-oh, Sara, we have to move!" Tom said. "That man is coming. He is the owner of the grapes. He will be mad at us."

"Hey, you little thief! What are you doing with my grapes? Give them back to me!"

But then they saw something in the sky. It was big and bright and yellow. It was the sunshine. They stopped playing and stared at it.
"Wow, look at that!" Lily said. "It is so brilliant!"
Tom nodded. "Yes, it is. It makes everything warm and shiny."
They wanted to touch it, but they knew it was too far and too hot. They wondered what it was and why it was there.
"Maybe it is a big ball of fire," Lily said.
"Maybe it is a giant lemon," Tom said.
They giggled at their silly ideas. They liked to imagine things.
They stared at the sunshine for a long time. They felt happy and curious. They liked the sunshine. It was their friend.

She screams and shakes her hand. The spider and the cobweb fall off. Sara runs away from the flower. She runs to her mom. She tells her mom what happened. Her mom hugs her and says it is okay. She says the spider was not trying to hurt her. She says the spider was just protecting its home.

Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They liked to splash in the pool and make bubbles with the soap. They had a big towel to dry themselves when they were done.
But then, Ben saw a butterfly. He wanted to catch it and see its colors. He ran after it, leaving the towel on the grass. Lily did not see him go. She was busy making a big bubble.
When Lily looked up, she could not find Ben. She called his name, but he did not answer. She felt scared and lonely. She wanted her brother to come back. She wrapped the towel around her and started to cry.
Ben followed the butterfly to the fence. He saw a hole under it. He thought the butterfly went through it. He crawled under the fence and found himself in a dark alley.

Tim and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. They were having fun. But then they saw a big dog. The dog was black and had sharp teeth. The dog was barking and running towards them.
"Help!" Tim shouted. "The dog is scary!"

Lily was sick. She had a fever and a sore throat. She felt very hot and very cold at the same time. She shivered under her blanket and hugged her teddy bear. She wanted her mommy to make her feel better.
Mommy came into Lily's room with a tray. She had a glass of water, a spoon and a bottle of pink medicine. She smiled at Lily and said, "You are a very brave and patient girl, Lily. I know you don't like the medicine, but it will help you get well soon. Can you try to take some for me?"
Lily nodded and opened her mouth. Mommy poured a little bit of the pink medicine on the spoon and gave it to Lily. Lily swallowed it and made a face. It tasted bitter and yucky. She wanted to spit it out, but she didn't. She drank some water to wash it down. She said, "Thank you, Mommy. I love you."
Mommy kissed Lily's forehead and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are a very good girl. Now, try to rest and sleep. I will check on you later." She tucked Lily in and turned off the light. She left the door open a little bit.
Lily closed her eyes and cuddled with her teddy bear. She still felt hot and cold and shivery, but she also felt a little bit better. She knew Mommy was taking care of her and the pink medicine was working. She hoped she would be well soon and play with her friends again. She fell asleep and dreamed of happy things.

"Come on, Tom, let's go on the slide. It is fun!" Lily said.
"No, Lily, I don't want to. The slide is too high. I might fall," Tom said.
Lily was persistent. She tried to make Tom go on the slide. She said, "Don't be scared, Tom. I will go with you. We can hold hands. It will be easy."
Tom still said no. He shook his head. He said, "No, Lily, I don't like the slide. I like the swings. Let's go on the swings."
Lily was sad. She wanted to go on the slide with Tom. She said, "Please, Tom, just try it once. Maybe you will like it. It is not scary. It is fun."
Tom looked at the slide. He looked at Lily. He saw that she was sad. He did not want to make her sad. He said, "Okay, Lily, I will try it once. But only once. And you have to hold my hand."
Lily smiled. She said, "Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend. I will hold your hand. Don't worry."
They went on the slide together. They held hands. They slid down fast. They felt the wind in their hair. They laughed.
They reached the bottom. They looked at each other. They were happy.
"Wow, that was fun!" Tom said.
"See, I told you!" Lily said.

Jill and Tom went to the beach with Mom and Dad. They liked to play in the sand and look for shells. They found many pretty shells of different colors and shapes. They put them in a bucket to take home.
"Look, Tom, I found an oyster!" Jill said, holding a big, gray shell. "Maybe there is a pearl inside!"
"Wow, let me see!" Tom said, running over to Jill. He wanted to see the pearl too.
They opened the oyster carefully, hoping to find a shiny, round pearl. But there was no pearl inside. Instead, there was a tiny crab, hiding in the oyster.
"Hello, little crab!" Jill said, smiling. "You are not a pearl, but you are cute!"
The crab waved its claws at Jill and Tom, as if to say hello back. Then it scuttled out of the oyster and into the water.
"Bye, little crab!" Tom said, waving. "Have fun in the sea!"
Jill and Tom were not sad that they did not find a pearl. They were happy that they made a new friend. They put the oyster back in the sand and looked for more shells. They were ready for more adventures.




Sam and Mia were playing near the cliff. They liked to look at the big rocks and the water below. They saw some birds flying and some fish jumping.
"Look, Sam, a big bird!" Mia said, pointing at a gray and white eagle.
Sam blinked. He was scared of the big bird. He thought it might hurt them.
"Let's go away, Mia. The big bird is angry," he said, pulling her hand.
But Mia did not want to go. She wanted to see the big bird more.
"No, Sam, the big bird is not angry. It is ancient. It knows many things. Maybe it can talk to us," she said, letting go of his hand.
She walked closer to the cliff, where the big bird was sitting on a branch. She smiled and waved at it.
"Hello, big bird. What is your name?" she asked.
The big bird looked at Mia with its yellow eyes. It opened its beak and made a loud sound.
"Kaaaw! Kaaaw!" it said.
Mia was not afraid. She thought the big bird was saying hello.
"Kaaaw! Kaaaw!" she said back.
Sam was very afraid. He saw the big bird flap its wings and fly towards Mia. He thought the big bird was going to take her away.
"Mia, come back! The big bird is bad! It will eat you!" he shouted, running after her.
But Mia did not hear him. She was too happy to see the big bird. She reached out her hand to touch it.
The big bird landed on Mia's hand. It was heavy and warm. It looked at Mia with its yellow eyes. It opened its beak and made a soft sound.
"Mia. Mia," it said.
Mia was amazed. The big bird knew her name. She felt a special bond with it.
"Wow, you can talk! You are amazing, big bird. What is your name?" she asked.
The big bird made a soft sound again.
"Ella. Ella," it said.
Mia smiled. She liked the big bird's name.
"Ella, you are my friend. I like you, Ella," she said.
Ella nodded. She liked Mia too. She felt a special bond with her.
"Mia, you are my friend. I like you, Mia," she said.
Sam reached the cliff. He saw Mia and Ella talking and holding hands. He was shocked and confused. He did not understand how the big bird could talk and be friendly.
"Mia, what are you doing? How do you know the big bird? How does it know you?" he asked.
Mia turned to Sam. She saw that he was scared and worried. She felt sorry for him.
"Sam, don't be scared. This is Ella. She is an ancient bird. She knows many things. She knows my name. She is my friend. She will not hurt us. She can be your friend too," she said.
Sam blinked. He did not know what to think. He looked at Ella. She looked at him with her yellow eyes. She opened her beak and made a soft sound.
"Sam. Sam," she said.
Sam felt a strange feeling in his chest. He felt curious and calm. He reached out his hand to touch Ella.
"Hello, Ella. You are an ancient bird. You know many things. You know my name. You are Mia's friend. You can be my friend too," he said.
Ella nodded. She was happy to have two friends. She felt a special bond with them.
"Mia, Sam, you are my friends. I like you, Mia. I like you, Sam," she said.
Mia, Sam, and Ella smiled. They felt a special bond with each other. They stayed on the cliff, talking and playing, until the sun set. They did not notice the time. They did not notice the other birds and fish. They only noticed each other. They were happy. They were friends.

"Mom, can I go on the slide?" Tom asked.
"Sure, honey, but you have to ask the man nicely if he can move," Mom said.
Tom walked up to the man and said, "Hello, sir. Can I please go on the slide?"
The man did not answer. He just frowned and looked away.
Tom felt bad. He wondered why the man was so unhappy. He decided to try again.
"Sir, I'm sorry if you are sad. Do you want to talk to me?" Tom said.
The man looked at Tom with surprise. He saw that Tom was not mean or rude. He saw that Tom was kind and curious.
The man smiled a little and said, "Well, hello, young man. You are very polite. I'm sorry I was rude to you. I'm just feeling lonely and bored. I used to love going on the slide when I was your age, but now I can't."
Tom felt sorry for the man. He had an idea.
"Why don't you go on the slide with me?" Tom said. "It will be fun. I can help you."

Lily was a girl who liked to demand things. She wanted to have all the toys, all the snacks, and all the attention. She did not like to share or say please or thank you. She thought she was amazing and everyone else was not.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom. She saw a big slide and ran to it. She did not wait for her turn. She pushed other kids out of the way and climbed up the ladder. She shouted, "This is my slide! Go away!"
But when she got to the top, she saw something that made her stop. There was a boy on the slide who was bigger and stronger than her. He had a red cape and a mask. He looked like a superhero. He said, "This is not your slide. This is my slide. I am amazing and you are not."
Lily felt scared and angry. She tried to demand that he move, but he did not listen. He laughed and slid down the slide. He landed on his feet and ran away. Lily was left alone on the top of the slide. She felt sad and silly. She realized that demanding things was not nice or fun. She wished she had been kind and polite.
She climbed down the slide and looked for her mom. She saw her sitting on a bench with a smile. She ran to her and hugged her. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I was not amazing. I was mean. Can we go home and play with my toys? I will share them with you."
Her mom hugged her back and said, "I'm proud of you, Lily. You learned a good lesson today. You are amazing when you are kind and polite. And I love you very much." They went home and played with the toys. Lily shared them with her mom and said please and thank you. She felt happy and amazing.

The man shook his head and said, "I'm sorry you lost your kite, but fighting won't bring it back. You should be kind to each other and share your toys. You are twins and you have each other. That's more important than a kite."
Lily and Ben felt ashamed and sorry. They hugged each other and said they were sorry. They thanked the man and his dog and went back to their ball and their bike. They decided to play with them and forget about the kite.

The younger bird was embarrassed and challenged the older bird to a whistle-off at the top of the olive tree. The older bird accepted the challenge and both birds flew to the top of the tree.
But soon the younger bird realized that her challenge was too much for her. She had bitten off more than she could chew. The older bird showed off his expert whistling, while the younger bird's was barely passable. 
The moral of the story is: don't compete with others and overestimate your abilities. It can lead to a bad ending.

"Are we there yet?" Sara asked.
"Soon, sweetie, soon," mom said.

"Can we still go on holiday?" Sara asked.
"I don't know, honey, I don't know," dad said.
They drove for a long time, but they could not find another way. All the roads were closed or busy or too far. The sun was going down and it was getting dark.
"We have to stop for the night," dad said. "We can't drive anymore. Maybe we can find a hotel or a motel or something."

Tom and Lily look in the kitchen. They see a big jar of cookies. They love cookies. They want to eat them. But the jar is on a high shelf. They cannot reach it.
Tom has an idea. He says to Lily, "Let's solve this problem. We can use a chair and a stick. I will stand on the chair and poke the jar with the stick. Then it will fall down and we can eat the cookies."
Lily thinks this is a good idea. She says, "OK, let's do it. But we have to be quick. Mom will be back soon."

Tom and Lily are scared. They say, "Sorry, mom. We were hungry. We wanted to eat some food. We tried to solve the problem. But we made a mistake."
Mom says, "You should have waited for me. I bought some food for you. I bought some fruit and some milk. They are healthy and yummy. You should eat them instead of cookies. Cookies are not good for you. They will make you sick."
Tom and Lily feel sorry. They say, "We are sorry, mom. We will not do it again. We will eat the fruit and the milk. We will be obedient."

Mom says, "I love you too. But next time, listen to me. And do not try to solve problems by yourself. Ask me for help. I will always help you."

Tom ran to the teacher and told her what Sara did. The teacher was not happy. She scolded Sara and made her apologize to Tom. She also made her clean the car and the glue.

Ben and Mia were playing in the bathroom. They liked to pretend they were grown-ups and use the things they found there. Ben saw a shiny thing on the sink. He picked it up and looked at it.
"What is this?" he asked Mia.
"It is a razor. Daddy uses it to make his face smooth," Mia said.
"Can I use it too?" Ben asked.
"No, Ben, it is not for playing. It is sharp and can hurt you. Put it back," Mia said.
But Ben did not listen. He wanted to imagine he was shaving like Daddy. He rubbed the razor on his cheek. He felt a sting and saw blood. He dropped the razor and started to cry.
"Mia, Mia, help me! It hurts!" he screamed.
Mia ran to him and saw his cut. She was scared and sorry. She hugged him and said, "I'm sorry, Ben, I'm sorry. Let me get Mommy. She will make it better."
She ran out of the bathroom and called for Mommy. Mommy came and saw what happened. She was angry and worried. She took Ben to the kitchen and cleaned his wound. She put a band-aid on it and kissed him.
"Ben, you were very naughty. You should never touch Daddy's razor. It is dangerous and can hurt you very badly. Do you understand?" she said.
"Yes, Mommy, I understand. I'm sorry, Mommy. I won't do it again," Ben said.

But then they hear a loud noise. It is a big truck. The truck comes to the park. It has a big shovel and a big bucket. It digs up the dirt and the grass. It makes a big hole. Ben and Mia are scared. They wonder what the truck is doing.
They see a man get out of the truck. He has a hat and a vest and a tool. He walks to the rock. He puts the tool on the rock. He pushes a button. The tool makes a loud noise. It breaks the rock. Ben and Mia are sad. They like the rock. They do not want the rock to break.
They run to the man. They shout and wave. They ask him to stop. They tell him the rock is their friend. They tell him the rock is cool and smooth. They tell him they sit on the rock and pause. They tell him they drink water on the rock. They tell him they love the rock.

He tells them he needs the rock. He tells them the rock is hot. He tells them the rock has fire inside. He tells them he uses the fire to make things. He tells them he makes things for people.

Sam liked to help his mom with the dishes. He would put the dirty plates and cups in the dishwasher and press the buttons. Mom said he was a good helper. But sometimes, Sam wanted to play with the dishwasher too. He liked to open and close the door, and pull out the racks, and spin the spray arms.
One day, when mom was busy in the living room, Sam decided to play with the dishwasher again. He opened the door and saw a shiny spoon. He grabbed it and ran to his room. He pretended the spoon was a rocket and made zooming noises. He did not hear mom calling him for lunch.
Mom came to Sam's room and saw the spoon. She was angry. She said, "Sam, where did you get this spoon? This is not a toy. This is for the dishwasher. You have to put it back. Now!" Sam felt bad. He said, "Sorry, mom. I was playing. I like the dishwasher." Mom said, "I know you like the dishwasher, but you can't take things from it. It can break. And then we can't wash the dishes. Do you understand?" Sam nodded. He said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I don't want to break the dishwasher. I want to help." Mom said, "That's good. Now, let's go and put the spoon back. And then we can have lunch."
They went to the kitchen and opened the dishwasher. But something was wrong. There was water everywhere. And the dishwasher was making a loud noise. Mom gasped. She said, "Oh no! What happened?" She looked inside and saw that one of the spray arms was missing. She said, "Sam, did you take the spray arm too?" Sam shook his head. He said, "No, mom. I only took the spoon. I don't know where the spray arm is." Mom said, "Well, it must have fallen off. And now the water is spraying everywhere. And the dishwasher is broken. You destroyed the dishwasher, Sam. You destroyed it!"
Sam started to cry. He said, "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to destroy the dishwasher. I didn't know it would break. I just wanted to play. Please don't be mad at me." Mom sighed. She said, "I'm not mad at you, Sam. I'm just disappointed. And frustrated. And wet. You have to be more careful, Sam. You have to listen to me. And you have to respect the things we have. They are not toys. They are tools. And they are not always available. Do you understand?" Sam nodded. He said, "Yes, mom. I understand. I'm sorry. I love you." Mom hugged him. She said, "I love you too, Sam. But we have a big problem now. We have to fix the dishwasher. Or get a new one. And we have to clean up this mess. And we have to wash the dishes by hand. And we have to eat cold lunch. Do you want to help me?" Sam said, "Yes, mom. I want to help. I want to be a good helper. And I don't want to play with the dishwasher anymore." Mom said, "That's good, Sam. That's very good. Now, let's get to work."

Her mom said, "I'm making a cake for your birthday, Lily. But you have to stop jumping in the kitchen. You can make a mess or hurt yourself. Why don't you go and play with your toys in your room?"
Lily said, "But I like to jump, mom. Jumping is fun. And I want to see the cake. Can I help you?"
Her mom said, "No, Lily. The cake is a surprise. And jumping is not fun in the kitchen. It's dangerous. You can burn yourself or break something. Please go and play with your toys in your room. I'll call you when the cake is ready."
Lily was sad. She did not want to leave the kitchen. She wanted to jump and see the cake. But she knew her mom was right. Jumping in the kitchen was not a good idea. She said, "Okay, mom. I'm sorry. I'll go and play with my toys in my room. But can I jump on my bed?"
Her mom said, "Yes, Lily. You can jump on your bed. But be careful. And don't jump too high. I love you, Lily. Happy birthday."
Lily said, "I love you too, mom. Thank you for the cake. I can't wait to see it." She gave her mom a hug and a kiss. Then she ran to her room and jumped on her bed. She was a gifted girl. She could jump very high and do many tricks.




Tom and Mia were playing in the woods. They liked to pretend they were brave hunters. They had sticks for spears and leaves for hats. They ran and jumped and laughed.
But then they heard a loud howl. It came from behind a big rock. Tom and Mia stopped and looked at each other. They felt scared.
"What is that?" Mia whispered.
"Maybe it is a wolf," Tom said. "Wolves are big and bad. They have sharp teeth and claws. They like to eat hunters."
Mia nodded. She wanted to go back home. She tugged on Tom's hand. "Let's go, Tom. The wolf might find us."
But Tom was stubborn. He wanted to see the wolf. He wanted to be brave. He shook off Mia's hand. "No, Mia. I want to see the wolf. Maybe I can scare it away with my spear. You stay here. I will go and look."
Mia did not understand. She did not want to stay alone. She did not want Tom to go. She tried to stop him. "No, Tom. Don't go. The wolf might hurt you. Please, Tom. Come with me."
But Tom did not listen. He ran to the big rock. He peeked behind it. He saw a big, black wolf. The wolf saw him too. It growled and bared its teeth. It jumped at Tom.
Tom screamed. He dropped his stick. He turned and ran. He ran back to Mia. He grabbed her hand. He said, "Mia, you were right. The wolf is big and bad. Let's go home. I am sorry I was stubborn."
Mia hugged him. She said, "It's okay, Tom. I am glad you are safe. Let's go home. Maybe we can play something else tomorrow."
They ran out of the woods. They did not look back. They did not hear the wolf howl again.




Sara and Ben were playing with their toys in the living room. They had a big box that they used as a house, a car, or a boat. They liked to pretend that they were on adventures.
"Let's go to the beach!" Ben said, putting on his hat and sunglasses. He grabbed a towel and a bucket. "We can make sand castles and find shells."
"OK!" Sara agreed, following him. She took her doll and a shovel. They dragged the box to the backyard, where there was a sandbox.
They put the box in the sand and climbed inside. They pretended that they were sailing on the ocean. They used the shovel and the bucket to make sand castles and dig holes. They found some rocks and sticks and pretended that they were shells and fish.
They had a lot of fun, but they also got very dirty. Sand was everywhere: on their clothes, in their hair, and on their toys. The sun was very hot and harsh. It made them thirsty and sweaty.
"Let's go inside and wash," Sara said, feeling sticky and itchy. "We can have some juice and cookies."
"OK," Ben said, feeling tired and thirsty. He grabbed the towel and the bucket. He helped Sara carry the box and the doll. They left the sandbox and went to the door.
But when they got there, they saw Mom waiting for them. She looked angry. She saw the sand and the dirt on them and on the floor.
"What have you done?" she asked, in a loud and harsh voice. "You made a big mess! You can't bring the box and the toys inside. They are too dirty. You have to wash them outside first. And then you have to wash yourselves. Go to the hose and spray everything. Now!"
Sara and Ben felt scared and sad. They did not mean to make Mom angry. They just wanted to have fun. They did not like the hose. It was cold and wet. They did not want to wash their toys. They liked them the way they were.
They started to cry. They dropped the box and the toys. They hugged each other.
"Please, Mom, don't be harsh," Sara said, in a small and soft voice. "We are sorry. We love you."
Mom saw their tears and heard their words. She felt sorry too. She realized that she was too harsh. She knelt down and hugged them.
"I'm sorry too," she said, in a gentle and kind voice. "I love you too. I know you were just playing. But you have to be careful. Sand can hurt your skin and your eyes. And dirt can make you sick. You have to wash it off. It's good for you. I'll help you. Come on, let's go to the hose. It will be fun. And then we can have some juice and cookies. OK?"
Sara and Ben nodded. They felt better. They smiled. They took the box and the toys. They followed Mom to the hose. They washed everything. They laughed and splashed. They had fun.
They learned that washing was not so bad. And that Mom was not so harsh. She was just trying to keep them safe and clean. They loved her. And she loved them.




Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and eat snacks. One day, their mom makes them a new snack. It is called salsa. She puts it in a bowl with some chips.
"Try this, Anna and Ben. It is spicy. It will make your mouth hot," mom says.
Anna and Ben look at the bowl. They are curious. They each take a chip and dip it in the salsa. They put it in their mouths.
"Wow!" Anna says. "This is spicy! I like it!"
"Ow!" Ben says. "This is spicy! I don't like it!"
He spits out the chip and drinks some water. He makes a face.
"Mom, I don't want this snack. I want cookies," he says.
He demands cookies. He holds out his hand.
"Sorry, Ben. No cookies today. You have to eat something healthy first," mom says.
She does not give him cookies. She gives him a carrot.
Ben does not want a carrot. He wants cookies. He is angry. He throws the carrot on the floor.
"Ben, that is not nice. You have to pick up the carrot and say sorry," mom says.
She is not happy. She points at the carrot.
Ben does not want to pick up the carrot. He does not want to say sorry. He crosses his arms and pouts.
Anna sees Ben. She feels sorry for him. She likes her brother. She has an idea.
"Ben, do you want to trade?" she asks.
She holds out her chip with salsa.
Ben looks at Anna. He looks at the chip. He thinks.
"OK," he says.
He takes the chip from Anna. He gives her the carrot.
Anna smiles. She eats the carrot. She likes carrots.
Ben smiles. He eats the chip. He likes chips.
Mom sees Anna and Ben. She smiles. She is proud of them.
"Good job, Anna and Ben. You are sharing and trying new things," she says.
She gives them each a hug and a kiss.
Anna and Ben are happy. They hug and kiss mom back.
They finish their snack. They go back to play with their toys. They are good twins.




Tom and Lily were friends who liked to play outside. They both had wagons that they used to carry their toys and books. Tom had a new wagon that was shiny and red. Lily had an old wagon that was brown and rusty.
One day, Tom saw Lily's wagon and said, "Your wagon is ugly and bad. My wagon is pretty and good. You should throw your wagon away and get a new one like mine."
Lily felt sad and angry. She said, "My wagon is not ugly and bad. My wagon is old and loved. My grandpa gave me this wagon when I was a baby. He said it was his wagon when he was a boy. He said this wagon has a lot of stories and memories. I value my wagon very much. You are mean and rude. You don't value anything but yourself."
Tom felt ashamed and sorry. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I was mean and rude. I didn't know your wagon was so special to you. I don't value anything but myself. You are right. I should value things that have stories and memories, not things that are shiny and new. Can you forgive me and be my friend again?"
Lily smiled and nodded. She said, "I forgive you, Tom. You are my friend again. Do you want to play with me and my wagon? We can share our stories and memories."
Tom smiled and nodded. He said, "Yes, I want to play with you and your wagon. We can share our stories and memories. Thank you, Lily. You taught me a lesson. I learned to value things that are old and loved, not things that are shiny and new."
The end.




Tom and Lily liked to play near the pond. They saw many frogs, ducks and fish there. But they also knew there was an alligator in the pond. The alligator was enormous and scary. It had big teeth and a long tail. Tom and Lily always stayed away from the alligator.
One day, Tom and Lily found a balloon. It was red and shiny. They wanted to play with it. They took turns holding it and throwing it in the air. They had a lot of fun. But then, the balloon flew away from them. It went over the pond and landed near the alligator.
Tom and Lily were afraid. They wanted their balloon back. But they did not want to go near the alligator. They thought of a plan. They found a long stick. They used the stick to poke the balloon. They hoped the balloon would pop and release the air. Then, the balloon would be small and light. They could pull it back with the stick.
But the plan did not work. The balloon did not pop. It only bounced. The alligator saw the balloon. It thought it was a toy. It opened its mouth and bit the balloon. The balloon popped and released a loud noise. The alligator was surprised and angry. It roared and splashed the water.
Tom and Lily were scared. They dropped the stick and ran away. They did not want to play near the pond anymore. They learned a lesson. They should not bother the alligator. The alligator did not like balloons.




Anna and Ben were playing hide and seek in the big house. Anna was the seeker and Ben was the hider. Ben ran to the living room and saw a long curtain that touched the floor. He thought it was a good place to hide behind. He moved the curtain a little and went inside.
Anna counted to ten and then opened her eyes. She looked around and tried to find Ben. She saw the toys, the sofa, the table, and the window. She did not see Ben. She wondered where he was. She walked to the living room and saw the curtain. She thought maybe Ben was behind it.
She walked to the curtain and pulled it back. She saw Ben, but she also saw something else. It was a big, furry, unknown animal. It had sharp teeth and claws and it growled at them. Anna and Ben were very scared. They did not know what to do.
They remembered what their mom had told them. She had said, "If you ever see an unknown animal, do not touch it or run away. Stay calm and trust me. I will come and help you." Anna and Ben trusted their mom. They held hands and said, "Mom, mom, help us!"
Their mom heard them and came to the living room. She saw the animal and recognized it. It was a bear that had escaped from the zoo. She grabbed a broom and chased it away. She hugged Anna and Ben and said, "You are very brave and smart. You did the right thing. I am proud of you." Anna and Ben were happy and relieved. They thanked their mom and said, "We love you, mom." They decided to play a different game.




Sam was a poor boy who lived in a small house with his mom and dad. He did not have many toys or clothes, but he was happy and kind. He liked to play with his red cap that his mom gave him for his birthday. He wore it every day, even when it was hot or cold.
One day, he saw a new boy in his street. The boy had a big bike and a blue cap. He looked very rich and proud. He rode his bike very fast and did not say hello to anyone. Sam wanted to be his friend, but he was afraid that the boy would not like him.
"Hi, I'm Sam. What's your name?" Sam said to the boy, holding his red cap in his hand.
The boy stopped his bike and looked at Sam. He saw his old clothes and his dirty shoes. He laughed and said, "My name is Max. And you are a poor and silly boy. Look at your cap. It is ugly and old. My cap is new and cool. You can't play with me. Go away!"
Sam felt very sad and hurt. He ran back to his house and cried. His mom saw him and hugged him. She said, "Don't mind Max. He is a rude and mean boy. He does not know how to be a good friend. You are a smart and sweet boy. You have a beautiful cap that I made for you with love. You can play with anyone you want. Why don't you invite some of your friends to come over and have some cookies?"
Sam smiled and wiped his tears. He said, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you and I love my cap. I will invite Tom and Lily and Ben. They are my good friends. They like me and my cap. We will have fun and share our cookies."
Sam called his friends and they came to his house. They played with his cap and his toys. They ate the cookies and drank some milk. They laughed and talked and had a good time. Sam was happy and forgot about Max. He learned that being rich or poor does not matter. What matters is being kind and generous. He also learned that his cap was not ugly and old. It was special and precious. It was a cap of friendship.




Lily was a spoiled girl who always wanted new toys. She did not like to share or play with her old toys. She only wanted the toys that she saw on TV or in the store. One day, she saw a big, shiny car that could seat four dolls. She asked her mom to buy it for her, but her mom said no. It was too expensive and Lily had enough toys already.
Lily was very angry and sad. She cried and screamed and threw a tantrum. She did not listen to her mom or say sorry. She ran to her room and slammed the door. She looked at her toys and hated them. She wished she had the big, shiny car.
The next day, Lily's mom had to go to work at the factory. She made clothes and shoes for other people. She asked Lily to come with her, because she could not find a babysitter. Lily did not want to go, but she had no choice. She put on her coat and shoes and followed her mom.
At the factory, Lily saw many machines and people working hard. They were noisy and busy and dirty. Lily did not like it. She wanted to go home and play with her toys. She told her mom that she was bored and hungry and tired. Her mom said that she had to work for a few hours and then they could go home. She gave Lily a sandwich and a juice and told her to seat on a chair and be quiet.
Lily ate her sandwich and drank her juice, but she was still bored. She looked around and saw a big pile of boxes. She wondered what was inside them. She got up from her chair and walked to the boxes. She opened one and saw a big, shiny car that could seat four dolls. It was the same car that she wanted. She was very happy and excited. She took the car out of the box and put it on the floor. She found four dolls in another box and put them in the car. She pretended that she was driving the car and having fun. She did not care that the boxes and the car and the dolls belonged to the factory and not to her. She did not care that she was being naughty and selfish. She only cared about the car.




Tom and Lily were playing in the bathroom. They liked to pretend they were pirates and use the towels as sails and the brushes as swords. They saw a shiny thing on the sink. It was a razor. Tom wanted to play with it.
"Look, Lily, a treasure!" he said. "Let's see what it can do."
He picked up the razor and tried to cut the towel. But the razor was sharp and it cut his finger. He cried out in pain and dropped the razor. It broke into pieces and they scattered on the floor.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Tom shouted. "It hurts, it hurts!"
Lily ran to him and saw the blood on his finger. She was scared and sorry.
"Tom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" she said. "You shouldn't play with that. It's not a treasure, it's a razor. It's for grown-ups, not for kids. It's dangerous and disgusting."
She wrapped his finger with a tissue and hugged him. She heard their mom coming.
"Mom, mom, help!" she called. "Tom cut his finger with a razor. It was an accident, we were playing pirates."
Their mom came into the bathroom and saw the mess. She was angry and worried.
"What have you done?" she asked. "How did you get the razor? You know you're not allowed to touch it. It's very sharp and it can hurt you. Look at all the blood and the broken pieces. It's disgusting and unsafe. You could have cut yourself worse or stepped on them."
She took Tom and Lily to the kitchen and cleaned and bandaged Tom's finger. She gave them both a hug and a kiss.
"I'm glad you're okay, Tom," she said. "But you have to be more careful and listen to me. Razors are not toys, they are tools. And you have to respect them and leave them alone. Do you understand?"
Tom nodded and said he was sorry. He felt bad and stupid.
"I understand, mom," he said. "I'm sorry, mom. I won't play with razors again. I don't like them. They're disgusting and they hurt."
Lily nodded and said she was sorry too. She felt guilty and sad.
"I'm sorry, mom," she said. "I should have stopped Tom. I don't like razors either. They're disgusting and they scare me."
Their mom smiled and said she forgave them. She told them to be more careful and to play with safer things. She said she loved them and they were her treasures. She took them to their room and gave them some books and toys. They said they loved her too and they were sorry. They hugged and kissed her and said they would be good. They learned their lesson and never played with razors again.




Tom and Anna are friends. They like to play and eat together. One day, they go to the park with their moms. They see a big truck with a picture of a waffle on it. They want to try a waffle.
"Mom, can we have a waffle, please?" Tom asks.
"Me too, me too!" Anna says.
Their moms smile and nod. They walk to the truck and wait in line. The man in the truck is very busy. He makes many waffles for many people. He is humble and kind. He says hello and thank you to everyone.
When it is Tom and Anna's turn, he asks them, "What kind of waffle do you want? I have chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla."
Tom and Anna look at each other. They do not know what to answer. They like all the kinds of waffles. They think hard.
"Um, can we have one of each?" Tom says.
"Yeah, one of each!" Anna says.
The man in the truck laughs. He says, "Sure, why not? You are very brave and curious. Here you go, one chocolate, one strawberry, and one vanilla waffle. Enjoy!"
Tom and Anna are very happy. They say thank you to the man and take their waffles. They sit on a bench and share their waffles. They taste each kind and say which one they like best.
"I like chocolate best. It is sweet and yummy," Tom says.
"I like strawberry best. It is pink and fruity," Anna says.
"I like vanilla best. It is white and creamy," the man in the truck says. He comes to the bench and sits with them. He has a waffle too.
Tom and Anna are surprised. They did not see him come. They smile and offer him some of their waffles.
"Thank you, that is very nice of you. But I have my own waffle. I like to eat one every day. It makes me happy," the man says.
Tom and Anna nod. They understand. They like to eat waffles too. They make them happy. They finish their waffles and lick their fingers. They say goodbye to the man and thank him again. They hug their moms and go home. They had a fun and tasty day. They are good friends.




Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play at the park together. They liked to go on the slide, the swings, and the seesaw. But today, there was a problem. There was a big girl on the slide. She wore a pink dress and a pink bow. She did not let anyone else go on the slide. She said it was her slide and she was the queen.
Lily and Ben waited and waited. They wanted to go on the slide too. They asked the big girl nicely, but she said no. She said they were too small and too silly. She laughed at them and pushed them away. Lily and Ben felt sad and angry. They did not like the big girl. They did not think she was a good queen.
Then, they had an idea. They whispered to each other and smiled. They ran to the swings and the seesaw. They had fun and made a lot of noise. They pretended they did not care about the slide. They hoped the big girl would get bored and leave.
But the big girl did not leave. She stayed on the slide. She watched Lily and Ben. She felt lonely and jealous. She wanted to play with them too. She wanted to have friends. She got off the slide and walked towards them. She tried to say hello, but they ignored her. They turned their backs and kept playing. They did not want to talk to her. They did not want to share with her.
The big girl felt sad and angry. She did not like Lily and Ben. She did not think they were nice. She cried and ran away. She wished she had been nicer. She wished she had shared the slide. She learned a lesson. She learned that being mean does not make you happy. She learned that being kind does.




Sara and Tom are playing with blocks. They want to make a big tower. Sara puts a block on top of another block. Tom puts a block next to Sara's block. They are happy.
But then, Ben comes. Ben is not nice. He likes to break things. He sees Sara and Tom's tower. He runs to it and pushes it. The blocks fall down. Sara and Tom are sad and angry.
"Ben, why did you do that?" Sara asks. "That was our tower. We worked hard to make it."
"I don't care. I like to break things. It's fun." Ben says. He laughs.
Sara and Tom don't like Ben. They want to make him stop. They look around. They see a big box. They have an idea.
They pick up the box and carry it to Ben. They put the box over Ben. Ben is under the box. He can't see or move. He is scared.
"Help! Let me out!" Ben cries.
Sara and Tom smile. They say, "Now you know how it feels to have your things broken. Maybe next time you will be nice and not break things."
They leave Ben under the box. They go back to their blocks. They start to make a new tower. They are grateful for their blocks and for each other. They are happy.




Lily and Max are playing in the kitchen. They want to make a cake for Mom. They have flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and chocolate. They put everything in a big bowl.
"Let's mix, mix, mix!" Lily says. She takes a big spoon and stirs the bowl. Max helps her. The bowl makes a funny sound. "Squish, squish, squish!"
"What is this?" Max asks. He looks at the bowl. The bowl is brown and sticky. It does not look like a cake. It looks like a mystery.
"Maybe we need more chocolate," Lily says. She breaks a big piece of chocolate and puts it in the bowl. She mixes again. The bowl makes a different sound. "Crunch, crunch, crunch!"
"Now what is this?" Max asks. He looks at the bowl again. The bowl is darker and harder. It does not look like a cake. It looks like a rock.
"Maybe we need more milk," Lily says. She pours some milk in the bowl. She mixes one more time. The bowl makes a smooth sound. "Swish, swish, swish!"
"Is this a cake?" Max asks. He looks at the bowl for the last time. The bowl is soft and shiny. It looks like a cake. It smells like a cake. It tastes like a cake.
"Yes, this is a cake!" Lily says. She smiles. Max smiles too. They are happy. They made a cake for Mom. They clean the kitchen and put the cake on a plate. They write a note for Mom. It says: "We love you, Mom. We made you a cake. It is a mystery cake. We hope you like it. Love, Lily and Max." They put the note next to the cake and wait for Mom to come home. They are proud of their cake. They are proud of their mix.




Lily liked to draw figures on paper. She drew people, animals, and things she saw. She used many colors and shapes. She wanted to show her drawings to someone.
One day, she saw a big poster on the wall. It had a figure of a man with a funny hat and a long beard. He was holding a book and a pen. The poster said: "Come and meet the famous writer Mr. Brown. He will show you his new book and sign it for you."
Lily was curious. She asked her mom: "Who is Mr. Brown? Why is he famous?"
Her mom said: "Mr. Brown is a writer. He writes stories for children. He is famous because many people like his stories. He is coming to the library today. Do you want to go and see him?"
Lily nodded. She said: "Yes, I want to see him. Maybe he will like my drawings. Can I show him my drawings?"
Her mom smiled. She said: "Sure, you can show him your drawings. Maybe he will be inspired by them. Let's go to the library."
They went to the library. There were many people waiting in line to meet Mr. Brown. Lily held her drawings in her hand. She was excited and nervous.
When it was their turn, Mr. Brown smiled at them. He said: "Hello, I'm Mr. Brown. What's your name?"
Lily said: "I'm Lily. I like your stories. I also like to draw figures. Can I show you my drawings?"
Mr. Brown said: "Of course, I would love to see your drawings. Let me see what you have."
Lily showed him her drawings. He looked at them carefully. He said: "Wow, these are amazing. You have a lot of talent and imagination. You are a very good artist. Can I keep one of your drawings?"
Lily was surprised and happy. She said: "Yes, you can keep one. Which one do you like?"
Mr. Brown said: "I like this one. It has a figure of a girl with a big hat and a long scarf. She is holding a book and a pen. She looks like a writer. Can I have this one?"
Lily said: "Yes, you can have it. It's me. I want to be a writer like you."

He signed the book and gave it to Lily. He said: "Thank you for your drawing. It's very special to me. Keep drawing and writing, Lily. You have a bright future ahead of you."
Lily hugged him. She said: "Thank you, Mr. Brown. You are very kind. I will read your book and write my own stories. Maybe one day, I will show them to you."
They said goodbye and left. Lily was very happy. She had met a famous writer and showed him her drawings. He had liked them and given her a book. She felt proud and inspired. She couldn't wait to read the book and write her own stories. She had a big smile on her face.




Anna and Ben are playing with their toy animals. Anna has a lion and Ben has a giraffe. They make the animals talk to each other.
"Hello, lion. I am giraffe. Do you want to be friends?" Ben says.
"Yes, giraffe. I want to be friends. You are very tall and I am very strong. We can help each other," Anna says.
They play for a long time, making the animals run, jump, and eat. They have fun and laugh a lot.
Soon, it is evening. The sky is dark and the stars are bright. Anna and Ben's mom calls them.
"Anna, Ben, it is time to go to bed. Come and brush your teeth and put on your pajamas," mom says.
Anna and Ben do not want to stop playing. They want to play more with their animals.
"Mom, can we play a little more? Please, please, please?" Anna says.
"Mom, we are having so much fun. Just a little more?" Ben says.
Mom smiles and shakes her head. She is patient with them.
"No, my loves. You have played enough for today. You need to sleep and rest. You can play more tomorrow. Come on, let's go," mom says.
Anna and Ben sigh. They know mom is right. They pick up their animals and hug them.
"Good night, lion. Good night, giraffe. Thank you for being my friend," Anna says.
"Good night, giraffe. Good night, lion. You are my best friend," Ben says.
They put their animals on their beds and follow mom. Before they go to their rooms, they bow to each other.
"Good night, Anna. Good night, Ben. You are my best sister/brother," they say.
They kiss mom and go to sleep. They dream of their animals and their friendship.




Jen and Ben liked to play with blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. They could make towers, bridges, houses, and more. They had a big box to keep their blocks in when they were done.
One day, Jen had an idea. She wanted to make a zigzag with the blocks. A zigzag is a line that goes this way and that way, like a snake. She took out many blocks and started to make a zigzag on the floor. She used red blocks, blue blocks, yellow blocks, and green blocks. She made the zigzag very long and very pretty.
Ben saw what Jen was doing and wanted to join. He took out more blocks and added them to the zigzag. He used orange blocks, purple blocks, white blocks, and black blocks. He made the zigzag longer and longer. He said, "Look, Jen, our zigzag is almost as long as the room!"
Jen and Ben were having fun, but they did not notice that they had used almost all the blocks in the box. The box was very empty. They also did not notice that their mom was coming to check on them. She wanted them to be tidy and put their toys away.
When mom opened the door, she saw the zigzag on the floor. She saw the blocks of many colors and shapes. She saw the empty box. She was not happy. She said, "Jen and Ben, what have you done? You have made a big mess with your blocks. You have filled the floor with a zigzag. You have not been tidy at all. You need to clean up right now!"
Jen and Ben looked at each other. They looked at the zigzag. They looked at the box. They looked at mom. They knew they had done something wrong. They said, "Sorry, mom. We were just playing. We will put the blocks back in the box. We will be tidy."
Mom nodded. She said, "Thank you, Jen and Ben. I know you like to play with blocks, but you also need to be responsible. Next time, please do not fill the floor with a zigzag. Please keep some blocks in the box. Please be tidy."
Jen and Ben said, "OK, mom. We will." They started to pick up the blocks and put them in the box. They learned their lesson. They still liked to play with blocks, but they also liked to be tidy.




Tom and Lily were very happy. They were going to camp with Mom and Dad. They packed their bags and got in the car. They sang songs and played games on the way.
When they got to the camp, they saw a big tent. Mom and Dad helped them open the tent and put their bags inside. Then they went to explore the camp. They saw a lake, a fire, and some other kids.
"Hi, I'm Tom and this is Lily. We are new here. Do you want to play with us?" Tom asked a boy and a girl who were throwing a ball.
"Sure, we are Jack and Anna. We are adventurous. We like to do fun things. Do you want to join us?" Jack said.
"Yes, we do. We are adventurous too. What do you like to do?" Lily said.
"We like to swim, fish, and hike. There is a lot to see and do here. Come on, let's go!" Anna said.
Tom and Lily followed Jack and Anna. They had a lot of fun at the camp. They made new friends and learned new things. They were very happy. They thanked Mom and Dad for taking them to the camp. They said they wanted to come back again.




Mia and Leo were playing with blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges and houses with the colorful blocks. Sometimes they would knock them down and start again.
"Look, Mia, I made a big tower!" Leo said, pointing to his creation. "It is taller than you!"
Mia looked at Leo's tower and felt a little jealous. She wanted to make a big tower too, but she only had a few blocks left. She looked around and saw a block on Leo's tower that he did not need. She had an idea.
She walked over to Leo's tower and reached for the block. She was about to remove it when Leo saw her.
"Hey, Mia, what are you doing?" Leo asked, frowning. "That is my block! You cannot take it!"
Mia felt scared and guilty. She quickly put the block back and hid her hand behind her back. She put her thumb in her mouth and looked down.
"I'm sorry, Leo," she mumbled. "I just wanted a big tower too."
Leo looked at Mia and saw that she was sad. He felt a little sorry for her too. He was thoughtful and had another idea.
He took a block from his tower and gave it to Mia.
"Here, Mia, you can have this block," he said. "We can share the blocks and make big towers together."
Mia smiled and took the block from Leo. She removed her thumb from her mouth and hugged him.
"Thank you, Leo," she said. "You are a good friend."
They both smiled and continued to play with the blocks. They made big towers and bridges and houses together. They had fun and were happy.

Ben feels sad and angry. He likes cars too. He wants to play with the steel car. He thinks Tom is not nice. He says, "No, Tom, that is not fair. The steel car is not only for you. It is for both of us. We can share it and play together. That is more fun."
Tom shakes his head. He does not want to share. He says, "No, Ben, go away. The steel car is mine. You have your own cars. Leave me alone."
Ben does not go away. He tries to grab the steel car from Tom. Tom holds it tight. They pull and push. They yell and cry. They fight over the steel car.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the room. She sees Tom and Ben fighting. She is not happy. She says, "Stop, boys, stop! What are you doing? Why are you fighting over a toy? That is not nice. That is not how brothers should be."
She takes the steel car from them. She says, "This steel car is not for anyone now. It is for the shelf. You cannot play with it until you learn to share and be kind. Now, say sorry to each other and hug."
Tom and Ben feel sorry. They say sorry to each other and hug. They say sorry to Mom too. They understand that sharing is better than fighting. They decide to play with their other cars together. They are happy again. They are good brothers.

Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to go camping with their dad. They had a small cabin in the woods where they could sleep and play. One night, they heard a loud noise outside. They were scared and ran to their dad.
"Dad, what is that?" Tim asked.
"It sounds like a bear, boys. Stay inside and be quiet," their dad said. He grabbed a flashlight and a stick and went out to scare the bear away.
Tim and Sam waited in the cabin, but they did not hear their dad come back. They heard more noises, like growls and thumps and screams. They were very troubled and hugged each other.
"Dad, where are you?" Sam cried.
But their dad did not answer. The bear had found him and hurt him very badly. He could not move or talk. The bear was hungry and angry and wanted more food. It smelled the boys in the cabin and broke the door with its claws. Tim and Sam saw the bear and screamed, but it was too late. The bear attacked them and ate them.

One day, Tom finds a suit in the box. It is a blue suit with a tie and a hat. Tom likes the suit. He puts it on and says, "Look at me, Sam. I am a boss. I can tell you what to do."
Sam does not like the suit. He thinks Tom is silly. He says, "No, you are not a boss. You are my friend. Take off the suit and play with me."
Tom does not listen. He says, "No, I like the suit. It is mine. You can play with the other toys. Go away."
Sam is sad. He does not want to play with the other toys. He wants to play with Tom. He says, "Please, Tom. Don't be mean. The suit is not yours. It is ours. We can take turns. Don't separate from me."
Tom is stubborn. He says, "No, I don't want to take turns. I don't want to play with you. You are not loyal. You are not my friend. Go away."
Sam is hurt. He does not understand why Tom is so rude. He says, "Fine. I will go away. But you are wrong. I am loyal. I am your friend. You are the one who is not loyal. You are the one who is not my friend."
Sam leaves the box. He finds another friend to play with. He is happy.
Tom stays in the box. He wears the suit. He is alone. He is not happy.




Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play in the park with their dog, Spot. Spot is big and brown and likes to run and bark.

"Hello, Fluffy," Ben says. He wants to pet the new dog. He thinks Fluffy is cute.
"Hello, Ben," Fluffy says. She wags her tail and licks Ben's hand. She thinks Ben is nice.
Lily is surprised. She did not know that dogs can talk. She looks at Spot. Spot does not talk. He only barks.
"Can you talk, Spot?" Lily asks.
Spot barks. He does not understand Lily. He does not care about Fluffy. He smells something good. He sees a man with a bag of meat. The man is walking to his car. Spot wants the meat. He runs after the man.
"Spot, come back!" Ben and Lily shout. They run after Spot. They are worried. They do not want Spot to get in trouble.
Fluffy and her owner watch them go. Fluffy is confused. She does not know why Spot wants the meat. She does not like meat. She likes dog food and treats.
"Are they your friends, Fluffy?" the lady asks.
Fluffy nods. She says, "Yes, they are. They seem fine. But Spot is silly. He does not know how to talk. He only knows how to bark."




Lily wanted to whistle like her big brother Tom. She saw him make a funny shape with his mouth and blow air. Then he made a nice sound that sounded like a bird. Lily tried to do the same, but she only made a puff of air. She tried again and again, but she could not whistle.
"Whistling is hard," she said to Tom. "How do you do it?"
Tom smiled and said, "You have to put your tongue behind your teeth and make a small hole with your lips. Then you blow gently and move your tongue a little. Like this." He whistled again and Lily watched him carefully.
She copied his mouth and tongue and blew softly. She heard a faint sound that was almost like a whistle. She was happy and tried again. She whistled louder and louder, until she was very proud of herself.
She ran to show her mom and dad her new skill. She did not see the shoe that was on the floor. She tripped over the shoe and fell down. She was clumsy and hurt her knee. She cried and dropped her mouth.
Mom and dad came to help her. They hugged her and kissed her knee. They said, "It's okay, Lily. You are not clumsy. You are brave and smart. You learned how to whistle today. That's amazing. Can you show us?"
Lily nodded and wiped her tears. She made the funny shape with her mouth and blew air. She whistled again and smiled. Mom and dad clapped and cheered. They said, "You are a great whistler, Lily. We are very proud of you." Lily felt happy and whistled some more. She forgot about the shoe and the pain. She only remembered the nice sound.

One day, Anna and Max are playing in the living room. Anna has a toy phone and pretends to call her friends. She says, "Hello, this is Anna. How are you?" Max listens and repeats, "Hello, this is Anna. How are you?" Anna laughs and says, "You are so smart, Max. You sound just like me."
Then, the real phone rings in the kitchen. Anna runs to answer it. She says, "Hello, this is Anna. Who is this?" She hears a familiar voice, but it is not her friend. It is Max. He says, "Hello, this is Anna. How are you?" Anna is surprised and confused. She says, "Max, is that you? How did you get the phone?"
She runs back to the living room and sees Max holding the phone in his beak. He has flown to the kitchen and picked up the phone when it rang. He is very proud of his trick. He says, "Hello, this is Anna. How are you?" Anna shakes her head and smiles. She says, "You are so silly, Max. You are not Anna. You are a parrot. But you are a very clever and playful parrot. I love you, Max." She hugs him and gives him a treat. Max says, "I love you, Anna. Thank you." They go back to playing with the toy phone.




Ben and Lily liked to play on the beach. They had a big surf that they could ride on the waves. They had fun splashing and laughing in the water.
One day, a new boy came to the beach. His name was Sam. He saw Ben and Lily's surf and he wanted it. He did not ask if he could play with them. He just ran and grabbed the surf from Lily's hands. He shouted, "This is mine now!"
Lily was sad and angry. She cried, "That is not nice! That is our surf! Give it back!" Ben was also sad and angry. He tried to get the surf back from Sam, but Sam was too strong. He pushed Ben away and ran to the water with the surf.
But Sam did not know how to ride the surf. He fell off and the waves took the surf away. He was scared and wet. He cried, "Help! Help! I want my surf!"
Ben and Lily saw Sam in trouble. They were still mad at him, but they also wanted to help him. They swam to him and pulled him to the shore. They gave him a towel and a hug. They said, "Are you okay? We are sorry you lost the surf."
Sam felt sorry too. He said, "I am sorry I was mean. I should have asked you if I could play with you. I should not have grabbed your surf. Can you forgive me?"
Ben and Lily nodded. They said, "We forgive you. We can share our surf with you. But you have to be nice and tidy. You have to put the surf back where you found it when you are done."
Sam agreed. He said, "Thank you. You are good friends. I will be nice and tidy. I will put the surf back where I found it when I am done."
They all smiled and played together on the beach. They learned that sharing is better than grabbing, and that being nice and tidy is better than being mean and messy.




Lily and Sam were hungry. They wanted to eat something yummy. They asked their mom to take them to the subway.

Lily wanted a haircut. She had long hair that got in her eyes and mouth. She asked her mom to take her to the salon. Mom said yes, but first they had to print a coupon.
Lily and mom went to the computer. Mom typed some letters and clicked the mouse. The printer made a noise and spit out a paper. Lily looked at the paper. It had a picture of scissors and a word she did not know.
"What is this?" Lily asked.
"That is a coupon, sweetie. It means we can pay less money for your haircut. We have to show it to the lady at the salon," mom explained.
Lily nodded. She liked saving money. She took the coupon and put it in her pocket. She and mom got in the car and drove to the salon.
At the salon, Lily saw a lot of people with different hair. Some had short hair, some had curly hair, some had colorful hair. She also saw a lady with a wide smile. She was holding scissors and a comb.
"Hello, I'm Sue. I'm going to give you a haircut. Do you have a coupon?" the lady asked.
Lily reached into her pocket and gave the lady the paper. The lady looked at it and smiled wider.

Tim and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big tower made of blocks. They wanted to climb it and see how high they could go.
"Let's go to the tower!" Tim said.
"OK, but be careful!" Lily said.
They ran to the tower and started to climb. They were having fun, but they did not see the dark clouds in the sky. Soon, it started to rain. The rain was heavy and cold. It soaked their clothes and hair. The blocks became wet and slippery.
"Oh no, the rain is bad!" Lily said.
"We have to go down!" Tim said.
But as they tried to go down, the tower started to fall. The blocks were cheap and weak. They could not hold the weight of the rain and the children. The tower crashed to the ground with a loud noise. Tim and Lily fell with it. They were not hurt, but they were very wet and dirty.
They got up and looked at the mess. The tower was gone. The blocks were broken and scattered. They felt sad and angry.

"Yum, these nuts are so good!" said Bunny.
"Let's take some to our homes!" said Squirrel.
They filled their cheeks with nuts and ran to their holes. But they did not see that the pile of nuts belonged to Bear. Bear was sleeping under the tree. He woke up and saw his nuts were gone.
"Who took my nuts?" he roared. He followed the trail of nuts to Bunny's hole. He saw Bunny hiding inside.
"Bunny, did you take my nuts?" he asked.
Bunny felt guilty. He knew he did a bad thing. He nodded his head.
"I'm sorry, Bear. I was hungry and I did not know they were yours," he said.

Bunny and Squirrel came out of the hole. They hugged each other.
"Thank you, Squirrel. You are a good friend," said Bunny.
"Thank you, Bunny. You are a good friend too," said Squirrel.

Lily and Ben were playing in the sandbox. They liked to make castles and roads with the sand. But sometimes they found pebbles in the sand. Pebbles were hard and round and not good for building.
"Look, I found a big pebble!" Ben said. He held it in his hand and showed it to Lily.
"Wow, that is a big pebble!" Lily said. "Can I see it?"
Ben gave the pebble to Lily. She felt it with her fingers. It was smooth and heavy.
"Can I keep it?" Lily asked. "I like it. It is pretty."
"No, it is mine!" Ben said. He tried to take the pebble back from Lily. But Lily held it tight.
"Give it back!" Ben said. He pulled harder.
"No, it is mine!" Lily said. She pulled harder too.
They both wanted the pebble. They both pulled and pulled. It was difficult to remove the pebble from each other.

"What are you doing?" Mom asked. She came to the sandbox.
"We found a pebble and we both want it!" Ben said.
"It is mine!" Lily said.
"No, it is mine!" Ben said.
Mom looked at the pebble. It was not very special. It was just a pebble.
"Listen, children," Mom said. "It is not nice to fight over a pebble. There are many pebbles in the sandbox. You can find another one. Or you can share this one. Or you can trade it for something else. But you cannot pull and hurt each other. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They felt sorry for fighting.
"OK, then," Mom said. "Why don't you say sorry to each other and give each other a hug?"
Lily and Ben said sorry and hugged. They felt better.
"Good," Mom said. "Now, do you want to keep the pebble or give it to me?"
Lily and Ben looked at the pebble. It was not very important anymore.
"You can have it, Mom," they said together.
"Thank you," Mom said. She took the pebble and put it in her pocket.
"Come on, let's go inside and have some juice," Mom said.

Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play in the garden. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big red truck. They would drive it around the grass and pretend to be workers.
One day, they saw a small green caterpillar on a leaf. They wanted to look at it, so they parked their truck under a tree and went closer. The caterpillar was very pretty, with yellow spots and a fuzzy body.
"Hello, caterpillar," said Tim. "Do you want to be our friend?"
The caterpillar did not answer, but it moved its head and waved its legs.
"Let's take it home," said Kim. "We can make a house for it and feed it leaves."

"Who did this?" cried Tim. "Our truck is broken!"
"It was Dan," said a voice. It was Lily, their neighbor. She had seen everything. "He was very foolish. He took your truck and played with it badly. He did not ask or say sorry."
Tim and Kim were angry and sad. They loved their truck and they had taken good care of it. They did not like Dan. He was mean and selfish.
"Can we repair it?" asked Kim. She picked up the wheel and tried to put it back.
"Maybe," said Lily. She was good at fixing things. "I have some tools and glue. We can try to make it work again."
"Thank you, Lily," said Tim and Kim. They gave her a hug. They were glad to have a good friend like her.

She carried the mug back to the table. She was very careful. She did not want to spill it. She put the mug next to her dolls. She said, "Here you go, dolls. I made you some tea. It is very yummy. You will like it."
She picked up one of her dolls. It was a chubby doll with curly hair and a pink dress. She pretended to make the doll drink the tea. She said, "Mmm, this is good tea. Thank you, Sara. You are a good hostess."
She paused. She heard a noise. It was her mom. She was coming back from the store. Sara knew she had to put the mug back. She did not want her mom to be mad.

"Wow, Ben, you are very good!" Anna says. She swings too, but not as high as Ben.

"What is your work?" Ben asks.
"I am a teacher. I teach big kids about science and math. These are my notes and tests. They are very important. But now they are all ruined!" the man says.
He sighs and shakes his head.
"I'm sorry, mister," Anna says.
"Can we help you?" Ben asks.
The man looks at Anna and Ben. He sees their curious and kind faces. He smiles a little.
"Thank you, kids. You are very sweet. And very intelligent. You want to learn new things. That's good. Maybe you can help me. Can you help me pick up the books and papers and put them back in the box?" he asks.
"Sure, we can!" Anna and Ben say.
They start to help the man. They pick up the books and papers and put them in the box. They are careful not to tear or bend them. They work together and have fun.
The man is happy and grateful. He thanks Anna and Ben for their help. He gives them each a book. The books have pictures and stories about animals and plants.
"These are for you. You can read them and learn more about science and math. You are very smart kids. I hope you enjoy them," he says.
"Thank you, mister!" Anna and Ben say.
They hug the man and say goodbye. They take their books and run back to the swings. They are very excited and proud. They have helped someone and learned something new. They are very happy and laugh a lot.




Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They see a big stone on the grass. Tom wants to pick up the stone and throw it. Lily says no, that is bad. The stone can hurt someone or something.
Tom does not listen to Lily. He picks up the stone and throws it hard. The stone flies in the air and hits a bird. The bird falls to the ground and makes a sad sound. Lily is scared and sad. She runs to the bird and tries to help it.
The bird's mom sees what happened. She is very angry. She flies to Tom and pecks his head. Tom cries and runs away. He drops his hat on the grass. The bird's mom takes the hat and flies away with it.
Lily calls Tom. She says he is sorry and he should come back. Tom is sorry too. He does not want to hurt the bird or lose his hat. He comes back to Lily and the bird. He says he is sorry to the bird and the bird's mom. He asks for his hat back.
The bird's mom sees that Tom is sorry. She is not angry anymore. She flies back with the hat and gives it to Tom. She makes a happy sound and flies away with her bird. Tom and Lily are happy too. They hug and say they are friends. They decide to play with something else, not the stone.




Tim and Jen are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big bunch of grapes on a tree. They both want to eat the grapes. They run to the tree and try to reach the grapes.
"Give me some grapes!" Tim says.
"No, they are mine!" Jen says.
They pull and tug at the grapes. They do not yield. They do not share. They get angry and sad.
A bird flies by and sees the grapes. The bird is hungry and smart. It lands on the tree and pecks at the grapes. It eats some grapes and flies away.
Tim and Jen stop and look at the bird. They see the bird is happy and full. They see the grapes are fewer and smaller. They feel silly and sorry.
"Let's share the grapes," Tim says.
"OK, let's share," Jen says.
They pick some grapes and eat them. The grapes are cool and sweet. They smile and hug. They are friends again.




Lily and Tom were friends. They liked to play together. One day, they found a big box in the yard. They opened the box and saw many things inside. There were clothes, hats, shoes, and jewels. Lily and Tom wanted to try them on.
"Let's play marry!" Lily said. She put on a white dress and a shiny ring. She gave Tom a black coat and a hat. "You are the groom and I am the bride," she said.
Tom nodded. He liked to play with Lily. He put on the coat and the hat. He looked at Lily and smiled. "You are a pretty bride," he said.
They walked to the door of the house. They wanted to show their parents their game. But the door was locked. They tried to turn the knob, but it did not move. They pushed and pulled, but it did not open. They banged and shouted, but no one heard them.
They were scared. They did not know what to do. They sat on the floor and cried. They wished they did not play marry. They wished they stayed with their parents. They wished they were healthy and happy. But they were not. They were stuck in the box. And no one came to help them. The end.




Lily and Ben wanted to see the parade. They liked the big balloons and the loud music. They asked Mom to take them to the street. Mom said yes, but first they had to tie their shoes.
Lily and Ben tried to tie their shoes. Lily made a knot with her laces. Ben made a loop with his laces. They were proud of their work. They showed Mom their shoes. Mom smiled and said, "Good job, kids. Let's go to the parade."
Lily and Ben followed Mom to the street. They saw many people and cars. They heard horns and drums. They looked for the balloons. They saw a big red balloon shaped like a dog. They saw a big yellow balloon shaped like a star. They saw a big blue balloon shaped like a fish.
Lily and Ben wanted to touch the balloons. They ran to the balloons. They did not see the cars. They did not hear Mom. They did not feel the laces. The laces came undone. The laces tripped them. Lily and Ben fell on the street.
The cars did not see Lily and Ben. The cars did not stop. The cars hit Lily and Ben. Lily and Ben screamed. Mom screamed. The balloons flew away. The parade was over.




Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together in the park. One day, they saw a big tent with many people inside. They heard music and laughter. They wanted to see what was inside.
They sneaked into the tent and saw a man and a woman in pretty clothes. The woman had a veil on her head. It was white and shiny. The man and the woman were holding hands and smiling. They looked happy.
Lily and Ben watched them for a while. They saw them kiss and hug. They heard the people clap and cheer. They learned that the man and the woman were getting married. They were uniting their hearts.
Lily and Ben thought that was nice. They wanted to do the same. They found a veil in a box. It was pink and sparkly. Lily put it on her head. Ben took her hand and smiled. They kissed and hugged. They pretended to be married. They united their hearts.
But then, a fierce dog came into the tent. It barked and growled. It saw Lily and Ben and ran towards them. It wanted to bite them. Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped the veil and ran away. They hid behind a tree. They hoped the dog would go away. They held each other tight. They were still best friends.




Lily and Tom were twins who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big jar of jelly on the table. They wanted to taste it, but they were too small to reach it.
"Let's crawl to the table and get the jelly," Tom said.
"OK, but be quiet. Mommy is sleeping in the sofa," Lily said.
They crawled slowly and quietly across the grass. They saw a lot of bugs and flowers on the way. They said hello to them, but the bugs and flowers did not answer.
They reached the table and climbed on a chair. They saw the jar of jelly shining in the sun. It looked yummy and colorful.
"Wow, look at the jelly. It is red and green and yellow," Tom said.
"Can I have some?" Lily asked.
"Sure, let me open the jar," Tom said.
He tried to open the jar, but it was too tight. He twisted and pulled, but the jar did not move.
"Help me, Lily," he said.
Lily helped him, but the jar was still too tight. They pushed and pulled, but the jar did not move.
They were so busy trying to open the jar that they did not hear Mommy waking up. She saw them on the table and smiled.
"What are you doing, my little ones?" she asked.
They looked at her and smiled back.
"We want some jelly, Mommy," they said.
Mommy laughed and hugged them.
"OK, let me help you with the jar. But first, let's wash your hands. They are dirty from crawling," she said.
She took them to the sink and washed their hands. Then she opened the jar and gave them each a spoon of jelly.
They tasted the jelly and made happy noises.
"Mmm, this is good jelly, Mommy," Tom said.
"Thank you, Mommy. We love you," Lily said.
Mommy kissed them and said, "I love you too, my sweeties. Now, let's go back to the sofa and have a peaceful nap. You must be tired from crawling."
They nodded and followed her to the sofa. They cuddled with her and fell asleep. They dreamed of jelly and bugs and flowers.

Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with their carts. They have red carts and blue carts. They push and pull their carts on the grass.
One day, they see a new boy in the park. He has a yellow cart. He does not play with anyone. He is shy.
Anna and Ben want to say hello to him. They walk to him with their carts. They smile and wave.
"Hi, I am Anna. This is Ben. What is your name?" Anna asks.
The new boy looks at them. He does not say anything. He holds his cart tight.
Anna and Ben are nice. They do not laugh or tease. They wait for him to talk.
"Hi, I am Leo. I like your carts. Can I play with you?" Leo says.

Anna and Ben are playing with their mom's makeup. They like to put lipstick, eyeshadow and blush on their faces. They think they look funny and pretty.
"Look at me, Anna!" Ben says. "I have red lips and blue eyes!"
"You look silly, Ben!" Anna says. "I have pink cheeks and purple lips!"
They laugh and make faces at each other in the mirror.
Mom comes into the room and sees them. She is not happy. She has a gray face and a frown.
"What are you doing with my makeup?" Mom asks. "You made a big mess!"
"Sorry, Mom," Anna and Ben say. "We were just playing."
Mom sighs and shakes her head. She takes a wet cloth and wipes their faces.
"You need to reverse this, kids," Mom says. "Makeup is not for playing. It is for grown-ups."
Anna and Ben nod and say sorry again. They help Mom clean the makeup and put it away.
Mom hugs them and smiles.
"I love you, Anna and Ben," Mom says. "But next time, please ask me before you use my things."
"We love you too, Mom," Anna and Ben say. "And we will ask you next time."
They kiss Mom and go to play with their toys. They decide to play with cars and dolls instead of makeup. They think they are more fun and less messy.




Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play with toys. One day, they found a big magnet in their dad's toolbox. They wondered what it could do.
"Let's examine it," Ben said. He held the magnet near a metal spoon. The spoon jumped to the magnet and stuck to it. "Wow, this is fun!" Ben said.
"Let me try," Lily said. She took the magnet and moved it near a metal car. The car also jumped to the magnet and stuck to it. "This is amazing!" Lily said.
They took turns to examine the magnet and see what else it could attract. They found nails, coins, keys, and even a necklace. They made a pile of metal things on the floor.
"Look at all the things we found!" Ben said. "We are so smart!"
But then, they heard their dad coming. He was looking for his toolbox. He saw the mess on the floor and the magnet in Ben's hand.
"Hey, what are you doing with my magnet?" he asked. "That's not a toy. It's a tool. You could have hurt yourself or damaged something."
Ben and Lily felt sorry. They did not know the magnet was not a toy. They did not mean to make a mess or take their dad's things.
"We're sorry, dad," they said. "We were just curious. We wanted to examine the magnet and see what it could do."
Dad was not angry. He was glad they were curious and wanted to learn. But he also wanted them to be careful and respectful.
"I understand, kids," he said. "But you have to ask me before you use my tools. And you have to put things back where they belong. The magnet is very powerful and can be dangerous. It can also damage some things, like the necklace. That's your mom's necklace. She will be very sad if it's broken."
Ben and Lily felt bad. They did not want to make their mom sad. They gave the necklace back to their dad and helped him put everything back in the toolbox. They also cleaned up the floor and apologized to their dad.
Dad hugged them and smiled. He was proud of them for being honest and helpful. He also gave them a small magnet of their own. He showed them how to use it safely and have fun with it.
"Thank you, dad," Ben and Lily said. "We love you. And we love our magnet. We will be more careful and respectful next time."
They learned a lesson that day. They learned that curiosity is good, but responsibility is also important. They learned that some things are not toys, but tools. And they learned that being smart also means being respectful.




Lily and Tom were going to the park with Mom. They liked the park. It had swings and slides and a big pond with ducks. Mom said they could feed the ducks some bread.
But on the way to the park, they saw a lot of cars on the road. They were not moving. They were making loud noises. Mom said it was traffic. Traffic was bad. It made them late.
Lily and Tom were bored. They wanted to get to the park. They looked out the window and saw a big truck. It had a picture of a lion on it. Lily and Tom liked lions. They were big and strong and had manes.
"Look, Mom, a lion!" Lily said.
"Where?" Mom asked.
"On the truck!" Tom said.
Mom looked at the truck. She smiled. "That's not a real lion, sweeties. That's a picture of a lion. It's for the circus. The circus is in town. They have animals and clowns and acrobats. Do you want to go to the circus?"
Lily and Tom nodded. They wanted to go to the circus. They liked animals and clowns and acrobats. Mom said they could go to the circus after the park.
But then something bad happened. The truck with the lion picture stopped. The door opened. A man came out. He looked angry. He had a whip and a hat. He was the lion tamer. He said something to the driver. Then he went to the back of the truck. He opened another door.
Lily and Tom gasped. They saw a real lion. It was not a picture. It was alive. It had yellow eyes and sharp teeth and a big roar. It did not like the whip and the hat. It did not like the lion tamer. It jumped out of the truck. It ran away.
The lion tamer shouted. He tried to catch the lion. But the lion was faster. It ran across the road. It ran towards the park.
Lily and Tom were scared. They did not like the lion anymore. It seemed hurt and angry. It seemed dangerous. They hoped it would not go to the park. They hoped it would not find the ducks. They hoped it would not find them.




Tom and Anna liked to play in the museum. They liked to look at the old things and make up stories about them. But they had to behave, or the museum lady would be angry. She always said, "This is history, not a playground. Don't touch anything or you will break it."
One day, Tom and Anna saw a big dinosaur bone. It was very long and white and had sharp teeth. They wanted to touch it and pretend to be dinosaurs. They looked around and saw that the museum lady was busy talking to some people. They thought she would not see them.
They ran to the dinosaur bone and started to play. Tom roared like a dinosaur and Anna laughed. They did not see the sign that said, "Do not touch. Fragile." They did not see the rope that was around the bone. They did not see the other museum lady who was watching them.
The other museum lady saw them and shouted, "Stop! You are not allowed to touch that!" She ran to them and tried to pull them away. But she was too late. Tom and Anna were too clumsy. They tripped over the rope and bumped into the bone. The bone wobbled and fell to the floor. It broke into many pieces.
Tom and Anna were scared. They heard a loud noise and saw the museum lady's face. She was very angry. She said, "What have you done? You have ruined history! You are in big trouble!" She took them to the office and called their parents.
Tom and Anna learned a lesson. They learned that they should behave in the museum. They learned that history is important and fragile. They learned that playing with dinosaur bones is not a good idea.




Lily and Ben were friends who lived in a small village. They liked to play together in the fields and the woods. One day, they found a big stick and decided to pretend it was a sword.
They took turns to hold the stick and say, "I am the king of the village! You have to do what I say!" Then they would fight with the stick and try to make the other one say, "You are the king, I give up!"
They had fun fighting with the stick, but they also got angry sometimes. They did not want to lose or share the stick. They shouted and pushed each other. They forgot to be nice and kind.
Soon, their mothers heard them and came to see what was wrong. They saw Lily and Ben fighting with the stick and making a lot of noise. They were not happy. They took the stick away and said, "You two have to stop fighting! Fighting is not a good way to play. You have to share and be gentle. Say sorry to each other and hug."
Lily and Ben felt bad. They knew their mothers were right. They said sorry to each other and hugged. They did not want to fight anymore. They wanted to be friends again. They said, "Let's go and play something else. Something that does not need a stick. Something that is fun and nice."
They ran off to find a new game. They were ready to play and laugh together. They were happy.




Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play with their toy boats. They had a big tub of water in the backyard where they could sail their boats and pretend to be pirates. Tom had a red boat and Sam had a blue boat. They always tried to make their boats go faster and farther than the other.
One day, Tom had an idea. He wanted to make his boat succeed and win the race. He saw a bottle of soap on the shelf and thought it would make his boat slippery and fast. He poured some soap on his boat and put it in the water. He said to Sam, "Look at my boat, Sam. It is so fast and shiny. You will never catch me!"
Sam looked at Tom's boat and saw that it was leaving a trail of bubbles behind. He thought it was cheating and unfair. He said to Tom, "That is not fair, Tom. You used soap on your boat. That is not how you sail a boat. You are a bad pirate!"
Tom did not care. He laughed and said, "I don't care, Sam. I just want to win. My boat is the best. You are a slow and silly pirate!"
Sam was angry and sad. He wanted to play with Tom, but Tom was being mean and selfish. He decided to teach Tom a lesson. He grabbed a stick and poked Tom's boat. The boat popped and sank in the water. The soap made the water messy and foamy. Tom was shocked and cried. He said to Sam, "What did you do, Sam? You broke my boat. You are a mean and nasty pirate!"
Sam said to Tom, "You deserved it, Tom. You were not playing fair. You were not being a good brother. You should not use soap on your boat. That is not how you sail a boat. You should be honest and kind."
Tom realized that he was wrong. He felt sorry and ashamed. He said to Sam, "I'm sorry, Sam. You are right. I was not playing fair. I was not being a good brother. I should not have used soap on my boat. I should have been honest and kind. Can you forgive me?"
Sam looked at Tom and saw that he was sincere. He said to Tom, "I forgive you, Tom. But you have to promise me that you will never use soap on your boat again. And you have to help me clean up this mess."
Tom nodded and said, "I promise, Sam. And I will help you clean up this mess. And maybe we can share our boats and play together."
Sam smiled and said, "That sounds good, Tom. Let's do that. And maybe we can be good pirates and find some treasure."
They hugged and went to clean up the mess. They learned that cheating is not the way to succeed and that being honest and kind is more important than winning.
The moral of the story is: Cheating is not the way to succeed and being honest and kind is more important than winning.




Sara and Ben were very happy. They were going to the festival with their mom and dad. The festival had many fun things to do. They had balloons, games, music, and food. Sara and Ben wanted to try everything.
They saw a big tent with a sign that said "Fly with us". Inside the tent, there were many colorful kites. Sara and Ben loved kites. They wanted to fly one in the sky. They asked their mom and dad if they could.
"Sorry, kids, but those kites are very expensive," their mom said. "We don't have enough money to buy one. Maybe we can make one at home later."
Sara and Ben felt sad. They really wanted to fly a kite. They looked at the kites with envy. They saw one that was very pretty. It had a rainbow tail and a star on it. Sara and Ben wished they had that kite.
They saw a man who worked in the tent. He was busy talking to some people. He did not see Sara and Ben. They had an idea. They sneaked into the tent and grabbed the rainbow kite. They ran out of the tent with the kite. They thought they were very clever.
They found a big field where they could fly the kite. They took turns holding the string. The kite soared high in the air. It looked beautiful. Sara and Ben felt happy. They forgot that they had stolen the kite.
But then, a strong wind came. It blew the kite away from their hands. They tried to catch the string, but it was too late. The kite flew higher and higher, until they could not see it anymore. It was gone.
Sara and Ben felt very sad. They had lost the kite. They also felt very guilty. They had done a bad thing. They had taken something that was not theirs. They had hurt the man who worked in the tent. They had lied to their mom and dad.
They decided to go back to the tent and say sorry. They hoped the man would forgive them. They also hoped their mom and dad would not be angry. They learned a lesson. They learned that stealing is wrong. They learned that flying a kite is not worth losing their honesty. They learned that the best things in life are not expensive, but priceless.




Lily and Max were playing in the park. They liked to search for shiny things in the sand. Sometimes they found coins, buttons, or beads. They put them in their pockets and showed them to their mom.
One day, they saw something very shiny in the sand. It was a gem. It was orange and sparkled in the sun. Lily and Max ran to pick it up.
"Wow, look at this!" Lily said. "It is so pretty!"
"Can I see?" Max asked. He reached for the gem, but Lily held it tight.
"No, it is mine!" Lily said. "I saw it first!"
"But I want to see it too!" Max said. He tried to grab the gem, but Lily pulled it away.
They started to fight over the gem. They pulled and pushed and shouted. They did not see the big dog that came near them. The dog saw the gem and thought it was a ball. He barked and jumped and snatched the gem from Lily's hand. He ran away with it in his mouth.
Lily and Max stopped fighting. They looked at the dog and the gem. They felt sad and sorry.
"Come back!" Lily cried. "That is our gem!"
"Bad dog!" Max yelled. "Give it back!"
But the dog did not listen. He ran to his owner and wagged his tail. He dropped the gem at his feet and licked his face.
Lily and Max ran after the dog. They tried to get their gem back, but the owner picked it up and put it in his pocket.
"Sorry, kids," he said. "This is my dog's toy. He likes shiny things too."
He walked away with the dog and the gem. Lily and Max looked at each other. They felt sad and angry.
They hugged each other and said sorry. They decided to share their other shiny things. They went back to the sand and searched for more. They hoped to find another gem someday.




Lila and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and swing on the swings. They saw a big tree with many branches. Some branches were low and some were high.
"Look, Ben, I can pull this branch!" Lila said. She grabbed a low branch and pulled hard. The branch was old and dry. It broke with a loud snap. Lila fell on the grass.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Lila cried. She hurt her hand and her knee. Ben ran to her and helped her up.
"Are you okay, Lila?" Ben asked. He saw blood on her hand and her knee. He felt sorry for her.
"I'm not okay, Ben. It hurts a lot." Lila said. She was sad and scared. She wanted her mom.
"Let's go find your mom, Lila. She can make you feel better." Ben said. He held her hand and walked with her. He saw a bench where Lila's mom was sitting. He called her name.
"Mom, mom, Lila needs you!" Ben shouted. Lila's mom heard him and saw them. She saw Lila's hand and knee. She got up and ran to them.
"What happened, Lila? What happened, Ben?" Lila's mom asked. She hugged Lila and looked at her wounds.
"Lila pulled a branch and it broke and she fell." Ben said. He told her what happened.
"Oh, Lila, I'm sorry. That was a bad branch. Let me clean your hand and your knee. It will sting a little, but it will help." Lila's mom said. She took out a tissue and some water and some band-aids from her bag. She cleaned Lila's hand and knee and put band-aids on them.
"Thank you, mom. Thank you, Ben." Lila said. She felt a little better. She smiled at her mom and her friend.
"You're welcome, Lila. You're a brave girl. And thank you, Ben, for being a good friend." Lila's mom said. She smiled at them both.
"Can we still play, mom?" Lila asked.
"Sure, Lila, but be careful. Don't pull any more branches, okay?" Lila's mom said.
"Okay, mom. I won't pull any more branches." Lila said.

Anna and Ben looked at the dog. He was holding their ball in his mouth. He dropped it and wagged his tail more. He looked happy and silly.
"Can we play with him, mommy?" Anna asked.
"Can we pet him, mommy?" Ben asked.
Their moms said, "Yes, you can. But first, you have to ask his owner. He is over there. He is wearing a blue jacket. He is nice too."
Anna and Ben walked to the man with the blue jacket. They said, "Hello, sir. Can we play with your dog? He is cute and funny."
The man smiled and said, "Hello, kids. Of course you can. His name is Spot. He loves to play with children. He is gentle and friendly. You can throw his ball and he will fetch it. You can pet him and he will lick you. He likes hugs too."

Tom and Mia were playing pirates in the backyard. They had a big barrel that they pretended was a treasure chest. They filled it with rocks, sticks, and shiny things they found.
"Arrr, matey, this is our loot!" Tom said, putting on a pirate hat. "We have to guard it from the other pirates!"
Mia nodded and picked up a wooden sword. She liked to play pirates with Tom. They made funny noises and had fun adventures.
But then they heard a growl from behind the bushes. It was Rex, the big dog from next door. He had escaped from his yard and smelled the barrel. He was eager to see what was inside. He ran towards Tom and Mia, barking loudly.
"Uh-oh, it's the sea monster!" Tom shouted. "He wants to bite our treasure!"
Mia was scared of Rex. He was much bigger than her and had sharp teeth. She dropped her sword and ran to the house.
"Help, help, Mommy!" she cried.
Tom was brave. He did not run away. He stood in front of the barrel and waved his sword.
"Go away, sea monster!" he yelled. "This is our treasure! You can't have it!"
Rex did not listen. He jumped on the barrel and tried to open it with his paws. He scratched and bit the wood, making a lot of noise.
Tom was angry. He hit Rex with his sword, but it did not hurt him. It was only a toy.
"Ow, ow, ow!" Rex yelped. He did not like to be hit. He let go of the barrel and ran back to his yard.
Tom cheered. He had saved the treasure from the sea monster. He was a brave pirate.
He went to the house to find Mia. He wanted to share the treasure with her. He hoped she was not too scared.
He knocked on the door and said, "Mia, Mia, it's me, Tom. The sea monster is gone. Come out and play pirates with me!"
Mia opened the door and smiled. She was happy to see Tom. She was not scared anymore.
"OK, Tom, let's play pirates!" she said. "But can we move the barrel to a safer place?"
Tom agreed. He and Mia moved the barrel to the porch. They put a blanket over it to hide it from the other pirates.
They played pirates until it was time for dinner. They had a lot of fun. They were the best pirate friends.




Lily was a friendly girl who liked to help others. One day, she saw a boy who was sad in the park. He had lost his note from his mom. The note said when to go home and what to eat for lunch. Lily wanted to cheer him up, so she gave him a hug and a cookie.
They played together for a while, until Lily saw a piece of paper under a slide. She ran to get it, hoping it was the boy's note. But she did not see the puddle of water on the ground. She slipped and fell into the puddle. She got wet and dirty and hurt her knee.
The boy saw what happened and ran to help her. He took the paper from her hand and looked at it. It was his note! He was so happy and grateful. He thanked Lily and helped her get up. He said he was sorry she slipped and got hurt. He gave her his jacket to keep her warm and dry.
Lily smiled and said it was okay. She was glad she found his note and made him happy. She said he was a good friend. They walked together to the boy's home, where his mom was waiting. She gave them both a hug and a sandwich. She said they were very kind and brave.
Lily and the boy learned that helping others can make you happy, even if you slip and get hurt. They also learned that friendship is a precious gift that can make you feel better. They decided to play together again soon and share more cookies and notes.




Anna and Ben were playing in the sand. They wanted to make a big castle with towers and walls. Anna had a spade and Ben had a bucket. They worked hard and had fun.
"Look, our castle is almost complete!" Anna said. "We just need to make the door and the flag."
"I want to make the door!" Ben said. "You can make the flag."
"No, I want to make the door too!" Anna said. "You always get to do what you want. You are so bossy!"
Anna and Ben started to argue. They both wanted the spade and the bucket. They pulled and pushed and shouted.
"Stop it, you two!" Mom said. She came over and saw the mess. "You are ruining your castle and your friendship. Why can't you share and take turns?"
Anna and Ben felt sorry. They knew Mom was right. They said sorry to each other and hugged.
"Let's finish our castle together," Anna said.
"OK, you can make the door and I'll make the flag," Ben said.
They smiled and used the spade and the bucket to complete their castle. They were proud of their work and their teamwork. Mom took a picture and praised them.
"You are such good builders and good friends," Mom said. "Now, who wants some juice and cookies?"




Tom and Sam are two squirrels who live in a big park. They like to play and look for nuts to eat. One day, they see a large nut on a branch. It is bigger than any nut they have ever seen.
"Wow, look at that nut!" Tom says. "It is so large and shiny. I want to eat it."
"Me too," Sam says. "But how can we get it? It is too high and far."
They stare at the nut and think of a way to reach it. They see a long vine hanging from another tree. They have an idea.
"Let's swing on the vine and grab the nut," Tom says.
"OK, let's try," Sam says.
They run to the vine and take turns to swing on it. They stretch their paws and try to catch the nut. But the nut is too large and heavy. It does not move.
"Ouch, this nut is hard," Tom says.
"It hurts my paw," Sam says.
They swing and swing, but they cannot get the nut. They are tired and hungry.
"Let's give up," Tom says. "This nut is not worth it. There are many other nuts in the park."
"OK, let's go," Sam says. "Maybe we can find a smaller and softer nut."
They leave the vine and the large nut. They do not know that the nut is not a real nut. It is a plastic toy that a child left on the branch. They run and play and look for other nuts. They are happy and forget about the large nut.




Lily and Ben are excited. They are going to the park with Mom and Dad. They put on their hats and shoes. They hold hands and march to the car. They sing a song as they march.
At the park, they see a big lake. They see ducks and fish and boats. They run to the edge of the water. They wave to the ducks and the boats. The ducks quack and the boats honk. Lily and Ben laugh and clap.
Mom and Dad call them for a picnic. They march back to the grass. They sit on a blanket and eat sandwiches and fruit. They drink juice and water. They say thank you to Mom and Dad.
After the picnic, they play on the swings and the slide. They make new friends and share their toys. They have fun and are happy. They wave goodbye to their friends and the park. They march to the car and go home. They are tired but still excited. They hug Mom and Dad and say they love them. They go to bed and dream of the park.




Ben and Mia love to go to the zoo with their mom and dad. They like to see the animals and learn their names. They have a favorite animal: the parrot. The parrot is famous because it can talk. It can repeat what people say.
One day, they go to the zoo and find the parrot in its cage. They say hello to the parrot and wait for it to talk. But the parrot is quiet. It does not repeat anything. Ben and Mia are sad. They wonder why the parrot is not talking.
They ask their mom and dad. Their mom and dad say that the parrot is shy. It does not like to talk when there are many people around. They say that the parrot needs some time and space to feel comfortable. They say that if they are patient and gentle, the parrot might talk to them.
Ben and Mia decide to try. They sit on a bench near the cage and watch the parrot. They talk to the parrot softly and kindly. They say things like "You are a beautiful parrot" and "We are your friends". They do not yell or make loud noises. They do not touch the cage or throw things at the parrot.
After a while, the parrot starts to move its head and look at them. It opens its beak and makes a sound. Ben and Mia are happy. They listen carefully. The parrot says "Hello, beautiful parrot". It repeats what they said. Ben and Mia clap their hands and laugh. They say "Hello, parrot" and "We are happy to meet you". The parrot repeats them too. It says "Hello, parrot" and "We are happy to meet you". Ben and Mia and the parrot have a fun conversation. They are all happy. The parrot is not shy anymore. It is famous and friendly.




Lily was a little girl who liked to look at herself in the mirror. She thought she was very pretty and smart. She liked to wear nice dresses and ribbons in her hair. She did not like to share her toys or play with other children. She only wanted to stay in her room and admire herself in the mirror.
One day, her mother made a delicious cake for her birthday. She invited some of Lily's friends to come and celebrate. Lily did not want to go downstairs and join the party. She wanted to stay in her room and eat the cake by herself. She took the cake from the kitchen and ran to her room. She locked the door and put the cake on her bed. She looked at herself in the mirror and smiled. She thought she was the happiest girl in the world.
But then, something strange happened. The mirror started to change. It showed Lily a different image of herself. She saw herself as a greedy and lonely girl. She saw herself with no friends and no fun. She saw herself with a big belly and a sad face. She saw herself growing old and ugly. She was scared and confused. She did not like what she saw. She wanted to see her real self again.
She ran to the door and tried to open it. But it was stuck. She could not get out. She cried and shouted for help. But no one heard her. Everyone was downstairs, having a good time. They did not miss her. They did not know she was in trouble.
Lily realized she had made a big mistake. She wished she had been kind and friendly. She wished she had shared her cake and played with her friends. She wished she had not been so vain and selfish. She wished she had not stayed in her room and looked at the mirror. She learned a hard lesson. She learned that beauty is not everything. She learned that happiness comes from giving and sharing. She learned that staying alone is not good. She learned that staying in the mirror is bad.




Sam and Mia are twins. They like to play in the backyard. But sometimes they fight over toys. One day, they see a big pile of laundry on the grass. It is Mom's laundry. She is hanging it on the line to dry.
"Look, a mountain!" Sam says. He runs to the laundry and jumps on it. He makes a big mess.
"Hey, stop that!" Mia says. She runs after him and tries to pull him off. "You are ruining Mom's clothes!"
"No, I'm not!" Sam says. He pushes Mia away. "It's fun!"
They start to fight. They pull and push and shout. They are fierce. They do not see Mom coming.
"Sam! Mia! What are you doing?" Mom says. She is angry. She sees her laundry all over the ground. Some of it is dirty and torn.
"Sorry, Mom," Sam and Mia say. They look down. They are ashamed.
Mom makes them pick up the laundry and help her wash it again. She tells them to be nice to each other and share their toys. She says fighting is bad.
Sam and Mia hug and say sorry to each other. They promise to be good. They learn their lesson.




Ben likes to play the drum. He has a big drum with a white skin. He hits the drum with his sticks and makes a loud sound. He likes to make a rhythm with his drum. He taps fast and slow, loud and soft.
One day, Ben's drum skin breaks. He hits it too hard and makes a hole. He is sad. He cannot play his drum anymore. He looks for something to replace his drum skin. He tries a paper, a cloth, a lid, but nothing works. They do not make a good sound.
Then, he sees his mom's cake. She has baked a cake for his birthday. It has a white frosting. It looks like his drum skin. He thinks it will work. He takes the cake and puts it on his drum. He hits the cake with his sticks. It makes a squishy sound. He likes it. He makes a new rhythm with his cake drum.
But his mom does not like it. She sees Ben playing with her cake. She is angry. She says, "Ben, what are you doing? That is not a drum. That is a cake. You have ruined it. You cannot replace your drum skin with a cake. That is silly."
Ben is sorry. He did not mean to make his mom angry. He says, "I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted to play the drum. I did not have a drum skin. I thought the cake would work. It looked like a drum skin. It was white."
His mom sighs. She says, "I know, Ben. I know you love your drum. But you cannot use a cake for that. A cake is for eating, not for playing. Come on, let's clean up this mess. And then, I have a surprise for you."
She takes Ben to the store. She buys him a new drum skin. She helps him fix his drum. She says, "There, now you can play your drum again. And you can make a rhythm with your sticks. But please, be careful. Do not hit it too hard. And do not use a cake again."
Ben is happy. He says, "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love my new drum skin. And I love you. And I love cake. But not for playing. Only for eating."
He hugs his mom. He plays his drum. He makes a rhythm. He is careful. He does not hit it too hard. He does not use a cake. He waits for his birthday. He hopes his mom will bake him another cake. A cake with a white frosting. A cake that he can eat. And not play.




Lily loved to sing and dance. She wanted to be a musician when she grew up. She liked to listen to different kinds of music and learn new songs.
One day, her mom took her to a park where there was a band playing. Lily was very excited. She ran to the front and watched the musicians with big eyes. They had guitars, drums, keyboards, and microphones. They played loud and fast music that made Lily want to jump and clap.
"Mom, can I talk to them?" Lily asked. "They are so cool!"
"Sure, honey, but be polite and wait for a break," her mom said.
Lily waited patiently until the band finished a song. Then she walked up to the stage and said, "Hi, I'm Lily. I love your music. You are very good musicians. How do you do that?"
The band smiled and thanked her. They were surprised and happy that a little girl liked their music. They asked her if she liked to sing and dance. Lily nodded and said, "Yes, I do. I want to be a musician too."
"That's awesome, Lily. You are very intelligent and brave to follow your dream," one of them said. "Do you want to join us for a song?"
Lily was thrilled. She nodded again and said, "Yes, please!"
The band gave her a microphone and invited her to the stage. They asked her what song she wanted to sing. Lily chose her favorite song, a nursery rhyme that she knew by heart. The band played along and Lily sang with all her heart. The people in the park clapped and cheered for her. Lily felt very happy and proud. She had made new friends and had fun. She hugged the band and thanked them. They told her to keep singing and dancing and to come back anytime.
Lily ran back to her mom and told her everything. Her mom hugged her and said, "I'm so proud of you, Lily. You are a wonderful musician. You made everyone happy with your music."
Lily smiled and said, "Thank you, mom. I love you. And I love music."




Tom and Lily are twins. They like to play in their house. Sometimes they play with their toys, sometimes they play with their dog, and sometimes they play on the stair.
One day, they decide to play on the stair. They take their pillows and blankets and make a fort. They pretend they are in a castle and they are the king and the queen. They enjoy their game very much.
But their mom is working in her room. She needs to be quiet. She does not like the noise that Tom and Lily make on the stair. She tells them to stop and play somewhere else.
Tom and Lily are sad. They do not want to leave their fort. They do not want to make their mom angry. They think of a way to play on the stair and be quiet.
They find some books and crayons. They sit on the stair and read and draw. They whisper to each other and giggle softly. They enjoy their new game too.
Their mom is happy. She can work in her room and be quiet. She is proud of Tom and Lily for being good and creative. She gives them a hug and a kiss and tells them she loves them.




Tom and Sam were brothers. They liked to play with their toys in their room. One day, their mom said they had to sell some of their toys, because they had too many. She gave them a big trunk and told them to put the toys they did not want in it.
Tom and Sam did not like this. They wanted to keep all their toys. They argued and fought over which toys to sell. Tom wanted to sell Sam's cars, and Sam wanted to sell Tom's dinosaurs. They pulled and pushed and shouted at each other.
"Stop it, you two!" their mom said. "You have to share and be nice. If you can't agree, I will choose for you."
Tom and Sam did not want their mom to choose. They decided to work together and find some toys they both did not like. They looked around their room and saw a big teddy bear. It was old and dirty and had a hole in its ear. They did not play with it anymore.
"Let's sell the teddy bear," Tom said.
"Good idea," Sam said. They picked up the teddy bear and put it in the trunk. They closed the lid and dragged the trunk to the front yard. They made a sign that said "Toys for sale".
Soon, some kids came by and looked at the toys. They saw the cars and the dinosaurs and the other toys. They liked them and asked how much they were.
"Five cents each," Tom said.
"Too much," the kids said. They walked away.
Tom and Sam were sad. They wanted to sell their toys and get some money. They waited and waited, but no one came back.
Then, they saw a girl walking by. She had long hair and a pink dress. She saw the trunk and came closer. She opened the lid and saw the teddy bear. She smiled and picked it up.
"Can I have this?" she asked.
"Sure," Tom said. "It's only one cent."
The girl gave Tom a penny and hugged the teddy bear. She said thank you and walked away.
Tom and Sam were happy. They sold their first toy. They looked at the penny and smiled.
But then, they heard a loud cry. It was their mom. She came running to the yard. She saw the girl with the teddy bear and gasped.
"What have you done?" she yelled. "That was my teddy bear! I gave it to you when you were babies. It was very special to me. How could you sell it?"
Tom and Sam were shocked. They did not know the teddy bear was their mom's. They felt very bad. They tried to get the teddy bear back, but the girl was gone. They had lost their mom's teddy bear forever. They were very sorry and very sad. They wished they had not sold it. They wished they had been more careful. They wished they had listened to their mom. They were very clumsy.




Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play at the park. There is a big plastic slide at the park. Lily and Ben want to go on the slide.
They run to the slide and take turns to climb the steps. Lily goes first. She sits on the slide and says, "Whee!" She slides down fast and laughs. Ben waits for his turn. He climbs the steps and sits on the slide. He says, "Whee!" He slides down fast and laughs too.
They do it again and again. They have fun. But then they hear a loud noise. It is a big dog. The dog barks and runs to the slide. Lily and Ben are scared. They do not like the dog. The dog jumps on the slide and slides down. He makes the slide dirty and wet.
Lily and Ben run away from the slide. They find their moms and dads. They tell them about the dog. Their moms and dads hug them and say, "It's okay. The dog is gone. You are safe. Do you want to play something else?"
Lily and Ben nod. They do not want to go on the slide anymore. They want to play with the swings and the sandbox. They hold hands and walk to the other side of the park. They are still friends. They are happy.




Ben was a dog who loved to swim. He liked to splash in the water and chase the fish. One day, he saw a big lake with many ducks. He wanted to swim with them and have fun.
He ran to the lake and jumped in. The ducks were scared and flew away. Ben felt sad. He wanted to make friends, not scare them. He looked around and saw a distant island. He thought maybe there were more ducks there. He decided to swim to the island.
He swam and swam, but the island was very far. He got tired and cold. His paws hurt and his fur was wet. He wished he had stayed on the shore. He was afraid he would not make it to the island or back to the land.
He saw a boat with a man and a girl. They saw him too. They waved and called him. "Poor dog, he is lost and in trouble. Let's help him," the man said. "Yes, let's. He looks so cute and brave," the girl said. They steered the boat to Ben and lifted him up. They wrapped him in a blanket and gave him some food and water.
Ben was happy and grateful. He licked their faces and wagged his tail. He had found new friends. He learned a lesson. He should not swim too far or chase the ducks. He should be careful and respectful. He should be happy with what he had. He thanked the man and the girl and they took him back to the shore. He ran to his home and told his family about his adventure. They were glad he was safe and smart. They hugged him and played with him. Ben was a happy dog who loved to swim.




Sara and Ben were twins who liked to play in the garden. They saw a big bush with red berries on it. Sara wanted to pick some berries, but Ben was scared of the thorns.
"Come on, Ben, the berries are yummy!" Sara said. She was enthusiastic about the berries. She reached for a branch, but it was too high.
"Help me, Ben!" Sara said. "You can support me and I can get the berries."
Ben shook his head. He did not want to support Sara. He thought the bush was prickly and the berries were sour.
"No, Sara, the bush is bad. It will hurt you and the berries will make you sick. Let's go play with the ball instead." Ben said.
Sara was angry with Ben. She wanted the berries very much. She did not want to play with the ball. She tried to climb the bush by herself, but she slipped and fell. She scraped her knee and cried.
Ben heard Sara cry and ran to her. He felt sorry for Sara. He hugged her and said, "I'm sorry, Sara. I should have supported you. Are you okay?"
Sara sniffed and nodded. She hugged Ben back and said, "It's okay, Ben. I should have listened to you. The bush was bad. The berries were not worth it."
Ben smiled and said, "Let's go inside and get a band-aid for your knee. Then we can have some cookies and milk. Maybe we can find some better berries another day."
Sara smiled and said, "Okay, Ben. That sounds good. You are a good brother. I love you."
They held hands and went inside. They were happy again.




Lila and Ben like to play with their toys on the carpet. They have cars, dolls, blocks and books. They make noises and stories with their toys. They have fun.
But sometimes the carpet is dirty. Mom says they have to fold the carpet and put it away. She says the carpet has dust and crumbs and hair. She says they have to clean the floor.
Lila and Ben do not like to fold the carpet. It is big and heavy. They have to lift it and bend it and roll it. They have to work hard. They get tired.
They wish they could keep playing with their toys on the carpet. They do not like to clean the floor. They think it is boring.
But they know Mom is right. They know the carpet is dirty. They know they have to help. They love Mom.
So they fold the carpet and put it away. They sweep the floor and wipe the dust. They make the floor shiny and clean.
Mom is happy. She hugs them and kisses them. She says they are good and helpful. She says they can play with their toys on the carpet again tomorrow. She says she loves them.

Lila and Sam were playing in the sand. They liked to pretend they were explorers in the desert. They had a big hat, a water bottle and a map.
"Look, Sam, the map says there is an oasis over there!" Lila said, pointing to a green spot on the paper.
"Let's go and see!" Sam said, excited. They got up and started to walk.
But the sun was very hot and the sand was very dry. They felt thirsty and tired. They wished they had a camel to ride.
"Maybe we should crawl, like snakes," Lila suggested. "It might be cooler and faster."
"OK, let's try," Sam agreed. They dropped to their knees and began to crawl on the sand.
They crawled and crawled, but the oasis seemed very far away. They wondered if it was real or just a picture.
"Are we there yet?" Sam asked, panting.
"I don't know," Lila said, squinting. "I think I see something green."
They crawled a little more, and then they saw it. It was an oasis, a small pool of water with some palm trees and grass. It looked like a paradise.
"Wow, we made it!" Lila exclaimed, smiling.
"Yay, we did it!" Sam cheered, clapping.
They ran to the water and splashed their faces. They drank some water and felt refreshed. They saw some brown dates hanging from the trees and picked some to eat. They felt happy and proud.
They decided to rest under the shade of the palms. They spread their hat on the ground and lay down.
"This is the best adventure ever," Lila said, cuddling with Sam.
"I agree," Sam said, closing his eyes. "You are the best explorer ever."
They fell asleep, dreaming of more adventures.




Tim and Sam were brothers. They liked to play outside in the mud. They had a big red jacket that they shared. They took turns wearing it.
One day, Tim wanted to wear the jacket, but Sam said no. He said it was his turn. They started to fight over the jacket. They pulled and tugged and yelled.
"Stop it!" Mom said. "You are making a mess. Give me the jacket. I will wash it and then you can both wear it."
Tim and Sam did not listen. They kept fighting. They did not see the big hole in the ground. They fell into the hole with the jacket. The hole was full of water. It was very cold and deep.
"Help!" Tim and Sam cried. "We are wet and cold. We can't get out."
Mom heard them. She ran to the hole. She was scared. She tried to reach them, but she could not. She called for help. She hoped someone would come soon.
But no one came. Tim and Sam were stuck in the hole. They were very sad. They wished they had listened to Mom. They wished they had not fought over the jacket. They wished they had been happy.




Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play in the farm with their mom and dad. They see many animals, like cows, sheep, chickens and pigs. The pigs are big and pink. They make loud noises. Lila and Ben think they are funny.
One day, Lila and Ben see a new animal in the farm. It is not big and pink. It is small and brown. It has long hair and sharp teeth. It runs very fast. It is a wild pig. The wild pig is not nice. It scares the other animals. It breaks the fence. It eats the corn.
Lila and Ben are scared too. They run to their mom and dad. They say, "Mom, dad, there is a wild pig in the farm! It is bad! It is mean! Help!" Mom and dad hear them. They see the wild pig. They are not happy. They get a big stick. They chase the wild pig away. They fix the fence. They check the animals.
Lila and Ben hug their mom and dad. They say, "Thank you, mom and dad. You are brave. You are good. We love you." Mom and dad hug them back. They say, "We love you too, Lila and Ben. You are smart. You are safe. You did well." They all go back to the house. They have some milk and cookies. They are happy. The wild pig is gone. The farm is peaceful. The end.




Lila and Ben were going on a trip with their mom and dad. They had to pack their bags with clothes and toys. Lila wanted to bring her doll, her book, and her crayons. Ben wanted to bring his car, his ball, and his dinosaur.
"Can I pack this too?" Lila asked, holding a shiny star. It was her wish star. She got it from her grandma, who said it could make her wishes come true.
"No, Lila, you can't," Ben said. "It's too big and heavy. And it's silly. Stars can't make wishes."
"Yes, they can," Lila said. "Grandma said so. And it's not silly. It's powerful."
They started to argue. Mom and dad heard them and came to see what was wrong.
"Why are you fighting?" mom asked.
"Lila wants to pack her wish star, but it's too big and heavy. And it's silly," Ben said.
"No, it's not," Lila said. "It's powerful. And I want to bring it."
Mom and dad looked at each other. They knew Lila loved her wish star, but they also knew it was not practical to bring it on the trip.
"Listen, Lila," dad said. "We understand that you love your wish star, but you can't pack it. It will take up too much space and it might get lost or broken. And you don't need it to make wishes. You can make wishes in your heart, and they will be just as powerful."
"Really?" Lila asked.
"Really," mom said. "Your heart is the most powerful wish maker. And you know what? You can share your wishes with Ben, and he can share his wishes with you. That way, you can both be happy and kind to each other."
Lila thought about it. She looked at her wish star, then at Ben. She smiled.
"Okay," she said. "I will leave my wish star here, and I will make wishes in my heart. And I will share them with Ben. What do you wish, Ben?"
Ben smiled back.
"I wish we have a fun trip, and we see lots of animals, and we eat ice cream," he said.
"Me too," Lila said. "And I wish we are always friends, and we don't fight."
They hugged each other. Mom and dad smiled.
"Good," they said. "Now, let's finish packing and go."
They packed their bags and went on the trip. They had a lot of fun, and they saw lots of animals, and they ate ice cream. And they were always friends, and they didn't fight. And they made wishes in their hearts, and they were powerful.




Tim and Lily were playing with their blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and houses and cars with the blocks. They had many colors and shapes of blocks to choose from.
But Tim wanted to use all the red blocks for his tower. He did not want to share them with Lily. He took the red blocks from Lily's pile and put them on his tower. Lily was angry. She wanted some red blocks too. She tried to take them back from Tim's tower.
"Stop it, Lily!" Tim shouted. "These are my red blocks! Go away!"
"No, Tim!" Lily shouted back. "You are not nice! You have to share the blocks!"
They shouted and pulled and pushed the blocks. They did not listen to each other. They were frustrated.
Then, something happened. Tim's tower was too tall and wobbly. It fell down with a loud crash. The blocks flew everywhere. Some of them hit Tim and Lily. They were in shock. They felt pain and fear. They stopped shouting and started crying.
Mom heard the noise and came to the living room. She saw the mess and the tears. She was not happy. She hugged Tim and Lily and checked if they were hurt. She said, "What happened here? Why were you shouting and fighting? You know you have to share and be kind to each other."
Tim and Lily felt sorry. They said, "We are sorry, Mom. We wanted the red blocks. We were frustrated. We did not mean to make the tower fall."
Mom said, "It's okay to want the red blocks, but you have to ask and wait for your turn. You have many other blocks to play with. You can make beautiful things together. You are brother and sister. You have to love and help each other."
Tim and Lily nodded. They said, "We love you, Mom. We love each other. We will share and be kind."
Mom smiled. She said, "That's good. Now, let's clean up the blocks and start again. What do you want to build?"
Tim and Lily looked at the blocks. They said, "We want to build a rainbow."




Tom and Lily were at the park with their mom. They saw a big slide and ran to it. They wanted to ride the slide and have fun.
But there was a woman in front of the slide. She was rude. She did not let Tom and Lily go on the slide. She said, "This is my slide. Go away. You are too small and slow."
Tom and Lily were sad and angry. They did not like the woman. They wanted to ride the slide. They asked their mom for help.
Their mom came to the woman and said, "Excuse me, can you please share the slide with my children? They are waiting nicely and they want to have a turn."
The woman looked at their mom and said, "No, I can't. This is my slide. I paid for it. You and your children are not welcome here. Go find another slide."
Their mom was shocked and mad. She said, "That is not true. This is a public park. The slide is for everyone. You are being very rude and selfish. You need to move and let others play."
The woman did not listen. She said, "No, I won't. This is my slide. You can't make me."
Their mom said, "Yes, I can. I will call the park ranger and he will make you. He will tell you to follow the rules and be nice. Or he will ask you to leave the park."
The woman was scared. She did not want to talk to the park ranger. She did not want to leave the park. She said, "Fine, fine. I will share the slide. But only for a little bit. Then I will come back and ride it again."
She moved away from the slide and let Tom and Lily go on it. Tom and Lily were happy. They thanked their mom and rode the slide. They had fun.
The woman watched them and frowned. She was not happy. She was still rude.




Tom and Sam were brothers who liked to play in the woods. They had a big axe that they used to chop wood for their fire. One day, they found a big tree that had many branches and nuts. They both wanted to chop it down and take it home.
"I saw it first!" Tom said. "It is my tree!"
"No, it is mine!" Sam said. "I have the axe!"
They began to quarrel and pull the axe from each other. They did not see the big bear that was sleeping under the tree. The bear heard the noise and woke up. He was angry and hungry. He roared and showed his teeth.
Tom and Sam were frightened. They dropped the axe and ran away. They did not want to chop the tree anymore. They wanted to go home and be safe.
The bear sniffed the axe and the tree. He did not like them. He went back to sleep under another tree. He hoped that Tom and Sam would not come back and bother him again.




Ben and Mia were hungry. They wanted to eat steak for dinner. But Mom said no. She said steak was too big and too hard for them. She said they had to eat soup and bread.

Anna and Ben were at the park with their mom. They saw a vendor with a big cart of balloons. The vendor had many colors of balloons: red, blue, yellow, green, pink, and purple. Anna and Ben wanted a balloon each.
"Mom, can we have a balloon?" Anna asked.
"Sure, sweetie. You can choose one color each. What color do you want?" Mom said.

But then, a strong wind came and blew their balloons away. Anna and Ben were very sad. They cried and ran after their balloons. But they could not catch them. The balloons flew higher and higher until they disappeared.

Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play on the farm. They liked to run, jump, and pet the animals. One day, they saw a big scale near the barn. They wanted to know how much they weighed.
"Let's go on the scale and see," said Lila.
"OK, but be careful. It looks old and rusty," said Ben.
They climbed on the scale and looked at the numbers. Lila weighed 15 kilos and Ben weighed 16 kilos.
"Wow, we are so big and strong," said Lila.
"Maybe we are bigger than the sheep," said Ben.
They got off the scale and ran to the field where the sheep were grazing. They saw a white sheep with a fluffy coat. They wanted to weigh it too.
"Come here, sheep. We want to play with you," said Lila.
She grabbed the sheep by the wool and tried to drag it to the scale. The sheep did not like that. It kicked and bleated and tried to get away.
"Help me, Ben. This sheep is heavy and stubborn," said Lila.
Ben ran to help Lila. He grabbed the sheep by the legs and pulled. The sheep was flexible and twisted its body. It broke free from Lila and Ben and ran away.
But Lila and Ben did not let go. They fell off the scale and hit their heads on the ground. They started to cry and bleed. The scale was broken too. It made a loud noise and fell apart.
The farmer heard the noise and came to see what happened. He saw Lila and Ben on the ground and the scale in pieces. He was angry and worried.
"What have you done? You hurt yourselves and the sheep and the scale. You are naughty and foolish. Go home and don't come back," he said.
Lila and Ben were scared and sorry. They ran home and told their parents what happened. Their parents were sad and mad. They had to take them to the doctor and pay for the scale. They said they could not play on the farm anymore.
Lila and Ben learned a hard lesson. They should not play with things they don't understand. They should not bother the animals. They should listen to their friends. They should be careful and kind.

But Ben likes rain. He wants to stay outside and feel the water on his skin. He shakes his head. "No, Mia. Rain is fun. I want to play in the rain."
Mia is scared of thunder. She runs to the door. She looks back at Ben. "Please, Ben. Come with me. Rain can hurt you. It can be fierce."
Ben does not listen. He stays on the grass. He laughs and jumps. He opens his mouth and catches the raindrops. He thinks rain is like a shower. He likes showers.
But then, the rain gets stronger. It falls faster and harder. It hurts Ben's eyes and ears. It makes him wet and cold. He does not laugh anymore. He cries.
"Mia, help me!" Ben shouts. "The rain is fierce. I want to go inside!"

After playing for a while, Timmy got tired and went inside to take a nap on his cozy sheet. He dreamed about throwing balls, leaves, and even a sheet up in the air! When he woke up, he was excited to go outside and play again.



Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved going to the beach with her family. Every time they went, she would run to the water and jump over the waves. She enjoyed feeling the water on her toes and the sand in her hands.
One day, they went to the beach in the evening. It was getting dark and the sky was turning black. Lily was a little scared of the dark, but she still wanted to play. She asked her dad if they could go closer to the water. He said yes and they walked towards the waves.
Lily saw the waves crashing against the shore and she thought it was so cool. She loved how the water moved and made a loud sound. She felt happy and safe with her family by her side. Even though it was dark, Lily enjoyed playing at the beach with her family.




Lily was a nosy girl who liked to observe everything. She always asked many questions and wanted to know what other people were doing. One day, she saw a man with a big cap on his head. She wondered what was under his cap and decided to follow him.
The man walked into a store and put his cap on a shelf. Lily sneaked behind him and grabbed his cap. She wanted to see what was inside. But when she lifted the cap, she saw nothing but hair. She felt disappointed and bored.
"Hey, what are you doing with my cap?" the man said, turning around and seeing Lily. He looked angry and scared. "Give it back to me!"
Lily dropped the cap and ran away. She felt sorry and ashamed. She realized that she should not have been so nosy and taken the man's cap. She learned that it was not nice to observe other people's things without asking. She decided to be more respectful and curious in a good way.




Tim and Mia are playing in the garden. They have a big box of toys. They like to dig holes and bury their toys. Then they pretend to be pirates and look for treasure.
"Look, I buried my car here," Tim says, pointing to a mound of dirt. "Can you find it?"
Mia nods and takes a shovel. She starts to dig. She likes to play with Tim. He is her best friend.
Suddenly, a strong wind blows. It makes a loud noise. It shakes the trees and the flowers. It lifts the dirt and the toys. It throws them everywhere.
"Wow, look at the wind!" Tim says, holding his hat. "It is very fast and noisy."
Mia drops her shovel. She is scared of the wind. She does not like it. It is too strong and loud. It makes her toys fly away.
"I don't like the wind," Mia says, running to Tim. "It is very mean and scary."
Tim hugs Mia. He is not scared of the wind. He thinks it is fun and exciting. But he sees that Mia is sad and afraid. He wants to make her feel better.
"Don't worry, Mia," Tim says, smiling. "The wind will go away soon. Then we can find our toys again. They are still here. They are just hiding."
Mia looks at Tim. She sees that he is kind and brave. She feels a little better. She smiles back.
"OK, Tim," Mia says, holding his hand. "Let's wait for the wind to go away. Then we can play again."
They sit down on the grass. They watch the wind blow. They wait for it to be quiet. They are still friends.




Tom and Lily are playing in the park. They like to pretend they are brave hunters. They have sticks that they call spears. They look for animals to hunt.
They see a big dog. It is brown and furry. It has a long tail. It is running and barking. Tom and Lily think it is a lion. They want to hunt it.
They rush after the dog. They hold their spears high. They shout and laugh. They think they are very clever.
But the dog is not a lion. It is a friendly dog. It belongs to a man. The man is walking in the park. He sees Tom and Lily. He is not happy.
He calls the dog. The dog stops running. It goes to the man. The man scolds Tom and Lily. He says they are nosy and rude. He says they should not chase his dog. He says they could hurt the dog or themselves.
Tom and Lily feel sorry. They did not mean to be nosy and rude. They did not know the dog was not a lion. They say sorry to the man and the dog. They put down their spears. They go back to their mom. They learn to be more careful.




Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play in the park. They liked to run, jump, slide and swing. But they did not like to share. They always wanted the same toy, the same snack, the same seat. They always fought and cried.
One day, they saw a big statue in the park. It was a statue of a lion and a mouse. The lion had a thorn in his paw and the mouse was helping him. The twins were curious and went closer. They saw a sign that said: "The Lion and the Mouse. A fable by Aesop. The moral is: A kindness is never wasted."
"What is a fable?" asked Tim.
"What is a moral?" asked Kim.
A lady who was sitting on a bench nearby heard them and smiled. She said: "A fable is a story that teaches a lesson. A moral is the lesson that the story teaches. Do you want me to tell you the story of the lion and the mouse?"
The twins nodded and sat down next to the lady. She told them how the lion was the king of the jungle, but he was also very proud and lazy. He did not care about the other animals and he did not listen to anyone. One day, he was sleeping under a tree when a mouse ran over his nose. The lion woke up and was very angry. He caught the mouse and said: "How dare you disturb me? I will eat you for breakfast!"
The mouse was very scared and said: "Please, Mr. Lion, spare me. I did not mean to bother you. I was just looking for food. If you let me go, I will be grateful and I will help you someday."
The lion laughed and said: "You? Help me? How can a tiny mouse help a mighty lion? You are too weak and small. But I am feeling generous today, so I will let you go. But don't ever come near me again."
The mouse thanked the lion and ran away. The lion went back to sleep.
A few days later, the lion was walking in the forest when he stepped on a sharp thorn. The thorn pierced his paw and made him bleed. The lion roared in pain and tried to pull out the thorn, but he could not reach it. He was in trouble and he needed help.
The mouse heard the lion's roar and recognized his voice. He remembered how the lion had spared his life and he decided to help him. He ran to the lion and said: "Mr. Lion, what is wrong? Can I help you?"
The lion was surprised and ashamed to see the mouse. He said: "Oh, it's you. I have a thorn in my paw and it hurts a lot. But you can't help me. You are too weak and small."
The mouse said: "Don't say that, Mr. Lion. You may be big and strong, but I am smart and brave. Let me see your paw. Maybe I can pull out the thorn."
The lion was doubtful, but he was also desperate. He said: "All right, try it. But be careful. Don't hurt me more."
The mouse climbed on the lion's paw and saw the thorn. He used his teeth and his claws and he pulled out the thorn. The lion felt a relief and thanked the mouse. He said: "You are amazing, little mouse. You have saved me. You have proved that you can help me. I was wrong to laugh at you and to be proud and lazy. I am sorry. Can you forgive me?"
The mouse said: "Of course, I forgive you, Mr. Lion. You have also proved that you can be kind and grateful. I am glad that we are friends. The moral is: A kindness is never wasted."
The twins listened to the story and learned the moral. They looked at each other and said: "We are sorry for fighting and crying. We should be kind and share. We should not be proud and lazy. We should be friends."
The lady smiled and said: "That's right, Tim and Kim. You have learned a valuable lesson. Now, go and play and have fun. And remember: A kindness is never wasted."




Lily was a little girl who liked to play pretend. She had a toy kitchen and a toy tea set. She liked to make tea and cookies for her stuffed animals. She would put them on a tray and carry them to the table. She would say, "Here you are, Mr. Bear. Here you are, Mrs. Bunny. Enjoy your tea and cookies." She would bow and smile.
One day, Lily wanted to try something new. She went to the fridge and found some cheese. She thought cheese would be good with tea and cookies. She put some cheese on the tray and carried it to the table. She said, "Here you are, Mr. Bear. Here you are, Mrs. Bunny. Enjoy your cheese and cookies." She bowed and smiled.
But Mr. Bear and Mrs. Bunny did not like cheese and cookies. They smelled the cheese and made a face. They said, "Yuck! This cheese is disgusting. It is old and moldy. We do not want to eat it. We want to eat fresh and yummy cookies." They pushed the tray away.
Lily was sad and confused. She did not know that cheese could be old and moldy. She thought cheese was always good. She looked at the cheese and saw that it had green spots. She felt sick. She said, "I am sorry, Mr. Bear. I am sorry, Mrs. Bunny. I did not mean to give you disgusting cheese. I thought it was good cheese. I will throw it away and make you new cookies."
She took the tray and went to the trash. She threw away the cheese and washed the tray. She made new cookies and put them on the tray. She carried them to the table. She said, "Here you are, Mr. Bear. Here you are, Mrs. Bunny. Enjoy your new cookies. They are fresh and yummy." She bowed and smiled.
Mr. Bear and Mrs. Bunny were happy and grateful. They smelled the cookies and made a face. They said, "Mmm! These cookies are delicious. They are warm and sweet. We want to eat them. Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend." They pulled the tray closer.
Lily was happy and proud. She had learned something new. She had learned that cheese could be old and moldy. She had learned that old and moldy cheese was disgusting. She had learned that fresh and yummy cookies were delicious. She had learned that her friends liked fresh and yummy cookies. She said, "You are welcome, Mr. Bear. You are welcome, Mrs. Bunny. You are my good friends. Let us have tea and cookies together." She sat down and joined them. They had a nice tea party.




Anna was very happy. Today was her birthday. She had a big cake with candles and a pink dress. She wanted to play with her friends and open her presents. But her friends did not come. They had other things to do. They ignored Anna and her birthday.

Then she heard a knock on the door. She opened it and saw a big box with a bow. She did not know who sent it. She opened the box and saw a puppy. The puppy was brown and fluffy and had a collar with a tag. The tag said: "Happy birthday, Anna. I am your new friend. My name is Spot."
Anna was very surprised. She had never seen a puppy like this before. It was unusual. But she liked it. She picked up the puppy and hugged it. The puppy licked her face and wagged its tail. Anna smiled and laughed. She forgot about her friends who ignored her. She had a new friend who loved her. She said: "Thank you, Spot. You are the best birthday present ever."

"Look, my duck can swim!" Sara says. She makes the duck go up and down in the water.
"My boat can sail!" Tom says. He blows on the boat and makes it move across the tub.
They play for a long time. The sun is hot and the water is cool. They get wet and so do their toys.
"Uh-oh, Mom is calling us!" Sara says. She hears Mom's voice from the house.
"Time to come in, kids! Lunch is ready!" Mom says.
Sara and Tom get out of the tub. They pick up their toys and run to the house.
"Wait, we have to dry our toys!" Tom says. He remembers that water can make toys go bad.
"You're right, Tom. You're very smart!" Sara says. She agrees with Tom.

Lila was a modest girl who liked to help her mom and dad. She did not ask for many toys or treats. She was happy with her books and dolls. One day, she saw a big train at the park. It had many cars and a loud whistle. Lila wanted to ride the train, but she was afraid.
She asked her mom, "Can I ride the train, please?"
Her mom said, "Yes, you can, but you have to try. It is not scary, it is fun. You can hold my hand if you want."
Lila nodded and followed her mom to the train. She saw a long line of people waiting to get on. She saw some kids who were excited and some who were nervous. She felt her heart beat fast.
When it was their turn, her mom helped her climb on the train. She sat on a seat near the rail. She held her mom's hand tight. She heard the whistle blow and the train start to move. She closed her eyes.
Her mom said, "Look, Lila, look at the trees and the flowers and the animals. They are so pretty. The train is going fast, but it is safe. You are brave, Lila, you are trying something new."
Lila opened her eyes and looked around. She saw the green grass and the blue sky and the yellow sun. She saw the birds and the squirrels and the rabbits. She saw the other kids smiling and waving.

Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play with toys. One day, they decided to trade some of their toys and see what they could get. Lila had a doll, a ball, and a car. Ben had a truck, a teddy, and a book.
"I want your car, Lila. It is fast and shiny. Can I trade you my truck for it?" Ben asked.
"OK, Ben. I like your truck. It is big and strong. Let's trade," Lila said. She gave Ben her car and took his truck.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Lila saw Ben's teddy. It was soft and cuddly. She wanted it too.
"Ben, can I trade you my ball for your teddy? I think your teddy is very cute. Please?" Lila asked.
"OK, Lila. I like your ball. It is round and bouncy. Let's trade," Ben said. He gave Lila his teddy and took her ball.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Lila saw Ben's book. It had pictures and words. She wanted it too.
"Ben, can I trade you my doll for your book? I think your book is very interesting. Please?" Lila asked.
"OK, Lila. I like your doll. It is pretty and has a dress. Let's trade," Ben said. He gave Lila his book and took her doll.
They played with their new toys for a while, but then Ben realized he had nothing left. He had traded all his toys to Lila. He felt sad and angry.
"Lila, you are not fair. You took all my toys. I want them back. Give them to me now!" Ben shouted.
"No, Ben. They are mine now. I traded them with you. You agreed. Go away!" Lila shouted back.
They started to fight and pull each other's hair. They were not friends anymore. They were enemies.
A teacher saw them and came to stop them. She was not happy. She scolded them and took away all their toys. She said they had to learn to share and be nice.
Lila and Ben felt sorry and ashamed. They had no toys and no friends. They had made a bad trade. They wished they had never traded their toys. They wished they had played with them together and had fun. But it was too late. They had ruined their day.




Lily and Ben were twins, but they were very different. Lily liked to play with dolls and draw pictures. Ben liked to play with cars and build blocks. One day, they had to share a tray of cookies that their mom made for them.
"Let's pray first," Lily said. She closed her eyes and folded her hands. "Thank you, God, for the cookies and for mom and dad and for Ben."
Ben rolled his eyes. He did not like to pray. He wanted to eat the cookies right away. He opened his eyes and reached for the tray.
"Hey, stop!" Lily said. She opened her eyes and saw Ben grabbing a cookie. "That's not fair! You have to pray first!"
"No, I don't!" Ben said. He bit the cookie and smiled. "Mmm, yummy!"
Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted to share the cookies with Ben, but he did not care. She started to cry.
Mom heard Lily crying and came to see what was wrong. She saw the tray of cookies and Ben's crumbs on his mouth.
"What happened here?" Mom asked.
"Lily wanted me to pray, but I didn't want to," Ben said.
"Lily, why did you want Ben to pray?" Mom asked.
"Because it's good to thank God for what we have," Lily said.
Mom nodded. She understood how Lily felt. She also understood how Ben felt. She loved them both, even though they were different.
"Ben, I'm glad you like the cookies, but you should respect Lily's choice to pray. Praying is a way of talking to God and showing gratitude. You don't have to pray if you don't want to, but you should wait for Lily to finish before you take a cookie," Mom said.
"Sorry, Lily," Ben said. He felt a little sorry for making Lily cry.
"Lily, I'm proud of you for praying, but you should respect Ben's choice not to pray. Not everyone believes in God or prays the same way. You can pray for yourself and for Ben, but you can't force him to pray with you," Mom said.
"Sorry, Ben," Lily said. She felt a little sorry for being angry at Ben.
Mom smiled. She hugged them both and gave them each another cookie.
"Can we still play together?" Ben asked.
"Of course we can," Lily said.
They ate their cookies and then played with their toys. They were different, but they were still twins. And they still loved each other.

She hears a knock on the door. She wonders who it is. She puts Lily down and goes to the door. She opens it and sees a boy. He is holding a toy car. He has short hair and a blue shirt. He smiles at her.
"Hi, I'm Ben," he says. "I live next door. Can I play with you?"
Anna notices his voice. It is gentle and friendly. She feels happy. She likes his voice. She thinks he might be a good friend.
"Hi, I'm Anna," she says. "This is Lily. She is my doll. Do you want to play with her?"

Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play and learn together. One day, they visit a farm with their class. They see cows, pigs, chickens and sheep. They are happy and curious.
"Look, Tom, this is where cheese comes from!" Lily says, pointing to a big machine that squeezes milk from the cows.
"Wow, cheese is yummy! I want to try some!" Tom says, licking his lips.
They follow the farmer, who shows them how he makes cheese. He cuts, cooks, and shapes the milk into blocks of cheese. He puts some cheese in a basket and gives it to the teacher.
"Thank you, farmer, for the cheese. It is very kind of you," the teacher says.
"You're welcome, teacher. I hope you enjoy it. But be careful, some cheese is very old and strong. It can make your mouth feel funny," the farmer says.
The teacher shares the cheese with the class. They all take a small piece and taste it. Some cheese is soft and mild, some cheese is hard and sharp. Lily and Tom like the cheese. They think it is delicious.
But some children do not like the cheese. They make faces and spit it out. They say the cheese is bad and stinky. They are rude and ungrateful.
"Yuck, this cheese is gross! I don't want it!" one child says, throwing his piece on the ground.
"Me neither! This cheese is nasty! I want candy!" another child says, tossing his piece in the air.
The farmer sees the children being wasteful and disrespectful. He is sad and angry. He scolds the children for their bad manners.
"Shame on you, children, for wasting good cheese. Cheese is a gift from the cows and the land. You should be thankful and polite. If you don't like the cheese, you can say no thank you, but you don't have to throw it away or insult it. That is not smart or nice," the farmer says.
The children feel ashamed and sorry. They apologize to the farmer and the teacher. They promise to be more careful and respectful next time.
Lily and Tom are smart and nice. They thank the farmer again for the cheese. They ask him more questions about the farm and the animals. They learn a lot and have fun.
The moral of the story is: Be thankful and polite for what you have. Don't waste or insult food. Be smart and nice.




Ben and Lily are twins. They like to play and have fun. One day, they find a big box in the garage. They think it is a good place to hide and scare Mom.

"OK, that sounds fun," Lily says. She gets in the box and closes the lid. Ben runs to the kitchen and says, "Mom, Mom, come and see what I found!"
Mom follows Ben to the garage. She sees the big box and wonders what is inside. She opens the lid and Lily springs out and says, "Boo!"
Mom is very surprised and jumps back. She laughs and says, "Oh, you got me! What a funny joke!"
But then she sees that Lily has a hurt face. She has a cut on her cheek from the box. Mom says, "Oh, no, Lily, are you OK? Let me see your face."
Lily starts to cry and says, "It hurts, Mom, it hurts!"
Mom hugs Lily and says, "I'm sorry, sweetie, it was an accident. Let's go and get a band-aid and some ice. You will be fine."
Ben feels bad and says, "I'm sorry, too, Lily. I didn't mean to hurt you. It was supposed to be a fun joke."
Lily says, "It's OK, Ben. I still love you. But next time, let's find a softer box."




Tom and Lily liked to play in the park. They had a big flag that they made with their mom. The flag had red and blue and yellow and green. They liked to wave the flag and run with it.
One day, a big dog came to the park. The dog was crazy. He barked and jumped and chased the kids. Tom and Lily were scared. They ran away from the dog, but the dog ran faster. He caught the flag and bit it. He tore the flag with his teeth. The flag was broken.
Tom and Lily were sad. They cried and hugged each other. They loved their flag. They wanted to fix it. They saw a man who worked in the park. He had a tool box and a hat. He looked nice.
"Excuse me, sir," Tom said. "Can you help us? The dog broke our flag. Can you repair it?"
The man smiled. He took the flag and looked at it. He said, "I can try. I have some tape and some scissors and some glue. Maybe I can make your flag look good again."
He opened his tool box and took out some things. He cut and taped and glued the flag. He worked hard and fast. He gave the flag back to Tom and Lily. The flag looked almost like new. It had red and blue and yellow and green.
Tom and Lily were happy. They thanked the man and gave him a hug. They waved their flag and ran with it. They played in the park and had fun. The dog was gone. The flag was repaired. The end.




Tim likes to jog with his dad. They jog in the park and see many things. They see birds, flowers, dogs and people. Tim likes to say hello to everyone. He is a compassionate boy.
One day, they jog near a big drain. The drain has a metal cover with holes. Tim is curious and looks inside. He sees water and mud. He wants to touch it, but his dad says no. He says the drain is dirty and dangerous.
Tim listens to his dad, but he sees something shiny in the drain. It is a coin. He thinks it is a treasure. He reaches for it, but his dad stops him. He says the coin is not worth it. He says he has a better treasure for him.
He takes out a small box from his pocket and gives it to Tim. Tim opens it and sees a compass. It is a gift from his dad. He says the compass can help him find his way. He says he loves him very much.
Tim hugs his dad and says thank you. He is very happy. He puts the compass in his pocket and holds his dad's hand. They jog away from the drain and continue their adventure.




Tommy was very tired. He wanted to sleep in his bed. But his bed had no pillow. He looked for his pillow everywhere. He could not find it.
He went to his mom. He said, "Mom, I need my pillow. Where is my pillow?" Mom was busy. She said, "I don't know, Tommy. Maybe you left it in the living room. Go and look there."
Tommy went to the living room. He saw a big pillow on the couch. He thought it was his pillow. He grabbed it and ran to his bed. He put it under his head. But it was not his pillow. It was an empty pillow case. It had no stuffing inside. It was flat and soft.
Tommy felt sad. He did not like the empty pillow case. He wanted his pillow. He went back to his mom. He said, "Mom, this is not my pillow. This is an empty pillow case. It has no stuffing. It is flat and soft. I don't like it. Please give me my pillow."
Mom looked at the empty pillow case. She said, "Oh, Tommy, I'm sorry. This is not your pillow. This is the pillow case I washed today. I forgot to put the stuffing back in. Your pillow is in the dryer. Wait a minute. I will get it for you."
Mom went to the dryer. She took out Tommy's pillow. It was warm and fluffy. She gave it to Tommy. Tommy hugged his pillow. He said, "Thank you, Mom. This is my pillow. I love it. It is warm and fluffy. I like it." He went to his bed. He put his pillow under his head. He closed his eyes. He fell asleep. He had a good dream.




Lily loved to carry her luxury doll everywhere. It was big and soft and had a shiny dress and a hat with a feather. Lily thought her doll was the best thing in the world and she did not want to share it with anyone.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and her doll. She saw some other kids playing with balls and trucks and bikes. She did not want to play with them. She only wanted to play with her doll. She hugged her doll and said, "You are my only friend. You are better than all the other toys."
But then, a big dog came running to the park. It saw Lily's doll and thought it was a toy too. It ran towards Lily and grabbed her doll with its mouth. It shook the doll and tore the dress and the hat. It made a big mess.
Lily was very scared and sad. She cried and cried. She wanted her doll back. She tried to get the dog to let go, but it was too strong and fast. It ran away with the doll.
Lily's mom came to comfort her. She said, "I'm sorry, Lily. That was a bad dog. It did not know that your doll was not a toy. But maybe you can learn something from this. Maybe you can be more kind and friendly to the other kids and their toys. Maybe you can share and play with them. Maybe you can make some new friends. That would make you happier than having a luxury doll."
Lily thought about what her mom said. She felt embarrassed for being so selfish and rude. She realized that her doll was not the best thing in the world. She decided to try to be more nice and open. She wiped her tears and said, "You are right, mom. I'm sorry. Can we go and play with the other kids?"
Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. Let's go and have some fun." They walked to the playground and Lily saw a girl with a ball. She said, "Hi, I'm Lily. Can I play with you?" The girl smiled and said, "Sure, I'm Anna. This is my ball. Do you want to catch it?" Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please. That sounds fun." They threw and caught the ball and laughed and talked. Lily felt happy and forgot about her doll. She made a new friend.




Lily liked to play with her friends at the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. One day, they saw a new thing at the park. It was a long line of stones. The stones were different colors and shapes. Some were big and some were small. Some were round and some were sharp.
Lily's friends wanted to walk on the line of stones. They said it looked fun and harmless. They said it was like a bridge or a train. Lily was not sure. She thought the line of stones looked hard and dangerous. She thought it could hurt her feet or make her fall. She did not trust the line of stones.
Lily's friends went to the line of stones. They started to walk on it, one by one. They laughed and cheered. They said it was easy and fun. They told Lily to join them. They said she was scared and silly. Lily felt sad and lonely. She wanted to play with her friends, but she did not want to walk on the line of stones.
Then, something bad happened. One of Lily's friends stepped on a sharp stone. He cried out in pain. He had a cut on his foot. It was bleeding. He could not walk. He needed help. The other friends stopped walking on the line of stones. They ran to him. They were sorry and scared. They did not know what to do.
Lily saw what happened. She felt sorry for her friend. She also felt glad that she did not walk on the line of stones. She knew she was right to not trust it. She ran to the bench where her mom was sitting. She told her mom what happened. Her mom was kind and smart. She had a band-aid and a hug. She went to help Lily's friend. She cleaned his wound and put the band-aid on it. She told him it would be okay. She told him to be careful next time. She told him to trust his feelings.
Lily's friend felt better. He thanked Lily's mom. He also thanked Lily. He said he was sorry for calling her scared and silly. He said he was wrong to walk on the line of stones. He said it was not fun and harmless. He said it was hard and dangerous. He said he learned a lesson. He said he would trust Lily more. Lily smiled. She forgave her friend. She was happy that he was okay. She was also happy that he trusted her. She hugged him and her mom. They all went back to the park. They played on the swing, the slide and the grass. They had fun and they were safe. They were good friends.

Tom and Lily liked to play with blocks. They had many blocks of different colors and shapes. They could create anything they wanted with their blocks. One day, they decided to create a nation with their blocks.
They used purple blocks to make a big castle. The castle was the home of the king and the queen of their nation. They used yellow blocks to make a wall around the castle. The wall was to keep the nation safe from bad people. They used green blocks to make fields and trees. The fields and trees were for the animals and the food of their nation.

He took a green crayon and a yellow crayon and started to draw a long line with bumps on his paper. He added a small circle for the head and two dots for the eyes. He smiled and said, "This is my caterpillar. He is my friend."
He showed his drawing to his mom, who was in the kitchen. She looked at it and said, "That's a very nice caterpillar, Ben. What is his name?"
Ben thought for a moment and said, "His name is Bob. He likes to eat leaves and he is very normal."
Mom nodded and said, "That's a good name for a caterpillar. Do you want to hang your drawing on the fridge?"
Ben nodded and said, "Yes, please. I want everyone to see Bob. He is very special to me."
Mom helped Ben to hang his drawing on the fridge with a magnet. She gave him a hug and said, "You are very creative, Ben. I'm proud of you."

Mom said, "You have to bathe, or you will not get any dessert. Now go to the bathroom and I will help you."
Ben and Lily ran to the bathroom, but they did not want to bathe. They had a plan. They hid behind the shower curtain and waited for mom. They thought mom would not find them.
Mom came to the bathroom and saw the empty bathtub. She said, "Where are you, Ben and Lily? I know you are here. I will search for you."
Mom looked under the sink, behind the door, in the cabinet, but she did not find them. She said, "You are very tough to find. But I will not give up. I will find you and make you bathe."

Lily was a playful girl who liked to run and jump and laugh. She had a big brother, Tom, who was not so playful. He liked to read and write and draw. He had a lot of books and papers and pencils in his room.
One day, Lily was bored and wanted to play with Tom. But Tom was busy doing his homework. He told Lily to go away and leave him alone. Lily was sad and angry. She decided to make Tom play with her. She went to the kitchen and found an iron. She knew that an iron was hot and could make things flat.
She ran to Tom's room with the iron. She saw Tom's books and papers and pencils on his desk. She thought they looked funny and messy. She wanted to make them flat and neat. She plugged the iron in the wall and turned it on. She did not know that an iron could also make things burn.
She put the iron on Tom's books and papers and pencils. She smiled and laughed. She thought Tom would be happy to see his things flat and neat. But Tom was not happy. He was very angry and scared. He saw the iron and the smoke and the fire. He screamed and ran to the kitchen. He got a bucket of water and threw it on the fire. He put out the fire and saved his things.
He looked at Lily and his eyes were cold and hard. He said, "Lily, you are very naughty and stupid. You could have burned the house and hurt yourself and me. You are in big trouble. I will punish you for what you did. You will not play or laugh or have fun for a long time. You will stay in your room and be quiet and sorry."
Lily was very sorry and scared. She cried and begged Tom to forgive her. She said, "Tom, I am sorry. I did not mean to make a fire. I just wanted to play with you. Please do not punish me. Please be nice to me. Please be my brother."
But Tom did not listen. He grabbed Lily and dragged her to her room. He locked the door and took the key. He said, "Lily, you will stay here until I say so. You will learn your lesson. You will never touch my things or the iron again. You will never bother me again. You will be a good girl or else."
Lily was alone and sad and afraid. She did not have anyone to play with or talk to. She did not have any toys or books or pictures. She only had the iron and the fire and the smoke in her mind. She wished she had never seen the iron. She wished she had never made Tom angry. She wished she had been a good girl. She wished she had a brother who loved her.

But then, Max comes. Max is not nice. He likes to break things. He sees the tower and he wants to knock it down. He runs to the tower and pushes it with his hand.
"Stop!" Lily and Tom shout. "Please, don't do that! We worked hard to make the tower. It is our tower. Go away!"
But Max does not listen. He laughs and pushes the tower again. The tower falls down. The blocks scatter everywhere. Lily and Tom are sad and angry. They cry.
"Why are you so mean, Max?" Lily asks. "Why can't you play nice with us?"
Max shrugs. He does not care. He looks for something else to break.
Lily and Tom pick up the blocks. They hug each other. They decide to make another tower. But this time, they move to a different place, where Max can't see them. They are still clever and careful. They hope Max will learn to be nice someday.

But then, a big boy came. He was older and taller than Mia and Ben. He was ignorant. He did not know how to play nicely. He saw the clay and wanted to take it.
"Give me your clay!" he said. "I want to make something better!"

Lila and Tom were twins who liked to play outside. One day, they found a big pile of pebbles near the river. They decided to make a game with them. They each took some pebbles and threw them into the water, trying to make the biggest splash.
"Look, I found a shiny pebble!" Lila said, holding up a smooth, black stone. "It looks like a star!"
"Let me see!" Tom said, reaching for the pebble. "Maybe it has magic!"
Lila did not want to share. She hid the pebble in her pocket and ran away. Tom was angry and chased her. They ran and ran, until they came to a dark forest.
"Stop, Lila!" Tom shouted. "Give me the pebble!"
"No, it's mine!" Lila shouted back. "Go away!"
They did not see the big bear that was sleeping behind a tree. The bear heard their noise and woke up. He was hungry and angry. He saw the two children and roared.
Lila and Tom were scared. They tried to run away, but the bear was faster. He caught them and ate them. The pebble fell out of Lila's pocket and rolled into the river. It was gone.
The moral of the story is: Do not be greedy and selfish. Share with your brother or sister. And do not disturb a sleeping bear.




Lily was very hungry. She wanted to eat something yummy. She saw a big tray on the table. The tray had many things on it. There were cookies, cakes, fruits, and cheese. Lily thought the tray looked amazing.
She ran to the table and grabbed a cookie. She took a big bite. It was sweet and crunchy. She smiled and reached for a cake. She took another bite. It was soft and creamy. She was very happy and reached for a fruit.
But then she heard a loud voice. It was Mom. Mom was angry. She said, "Lily, what are you doing? That tray is not for you. That tray is for the guests. You are very naughty. You did not ask. You did not accept what I gave you for lunch. You spoiled the tray. Now go to your room. No more treats for you today."
Lily felt very sad. She dropped the fruit and started to cry. She did not understand. She thought the tray was for everyone. She thought Mom would be proud of her for trying new things. She did not mean to be naughty. She just wanted to eat something amazing.
She ran to her room and slammed the door. She hugged her teddy bear and sobbed. She wished she had accepted what Mom gave her for lunch. She wished she had not seen the tray. She wished she had not been so hungry. She wished Mom would forgive her. She wished she could have another cookie.




Ben and Lily wanted to play in the garden. They saw some big jars on the table. The jars had labels on them. The labels said: "Do not touch. Dangerous."
"What are these?" Ben asked.
"I don't know. Maybe they are for Mom's plants," Lily said.
"Let's open them and see," Ben said. He reached for a jar.
"No, Ben, stop! The label says 'do not touch'. It is dangerous. It might hurt you," Lily said.
"But I want to see. Maybe it is something fun," Ben said. He did not listen to Lily. He opened the jar.
Suddenly, a loud noise came from the jar. Smoke and bubbles came out. Ben and Lily screamed. They ran away from the table.
Mom heard the noise and came to the garden. She saw the mess on the table. She saw Ben and Lily hiding behind a bush.
"What happened here?" Mom asked.
"Ben opened a jar. It made a big boom. It was scary," Lily said.
"Ben, why did you open the jar? Didn't you see the label? It was dangerous. I was preparing a science experiment for your big brother. You could have hurt yourself or Lily," Mom said.
"I'm sorry, Mom. I was curious. I wanted to see what was inside," Ben said.
"Curiosity is good, but you have to be careful. You have to follow the rules. You have to respect the labels. They are there to protect you. Do you understand?" Mom said.
"Yes, Mom. I understand. I won't do it again," Ben said.
"Good. Now, let's clean up this mess. And then, we can do something fun and safe together. How about we make some cookies?" Mom said.
"Yay! Cookies!" Ben and Lily said.
They hugged Mom and went to the kitchen. They learned their lesson. They never touched the jars again.




Lily and Sam were playing in the snow. They wanted to make an igloo, like the ones they saw in a book. They rolled big balls of snow and stacked them together. They left a hole for the door.
"Look, we made an igloo!" Lily said. "Let's go inside and pretend we live here."
They crawled inside the igloo and sat on the floor. They felt cozy and warm. They pretended they had a fire and a pot of soup.
"What kind of soup do you want?" Sam asked.
"I want spicy soup, like the one Mommy makes," Lily said.
"Me too," Sam said. "But we don't have any spicy things here. Only snow."
Sam had an idea. He crawled out of the igloo and looked around. He saw a red pepper in the garden. It was frozen, but still bright and shiny. He picked it up and brought it back to the igloo.
"Look, I found something spicy!" he said. "Let's put it in our soup."
He broke the pepper in half and gave one piece to Lily. They both bit into it and smiled.
"Mmm, spicy!" Lily said.
But then, they felt a burning sensation in their mouths. They gasped and coughed. Their eyes watered and their noses ran. They spit out the pepper and ran out of the igloo.
"Ow, ow, ow!" they cried. "That was too spicy!"
They ran to the house and asked Mommy for some water and milk. Mommy hugged them and gave them a glass each. She asked them what happened.
"We ate a spicy pepper from the garden," Lily said.
"We wanted to make spicy soup in our igloo," Sam said.
Mommy smiled and shook her head. She said, "Next time, be careful what you put in your soup. And don't eat frozen peppers. They are not good for you."
Lily and Sam nodded and drank their water and milk. They felt better and said sorry to Mommy. They learned their lesson. They decided to make a different kind of soup next time. Maybe carrot soup, or chicken soup, or tomato soup. But not spicy soup. Never again.




Sam and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. Sam had a big truck with four wheels and a horn. Mia had a doll with a dress and a hat. They were having fun making noises and moving their toys around.
Then, Sam saw a shiny knob on the shelf. He liked shiny things and wanted to see what it was. He put down his truck and climbed on the couch to reach the knob. He took it in his hand and turned it. It made a click sound.
"Look, Mia, I found a knob!" Sam said. "It can make sounds. Do you want to play with it?"
Mia looked at the knob and shook her head. She did not like the knob. It was not pretty or soft like her doll. She wanted to keep playing with her doll.
"No, thank you, Sam," Mia said. "I don't want the knob. You can have it."
Sam felt sad. He wanted to share the knob with Mia. He thought it was a fun toy. He had an idea. He decided to sell the knob to Mia.
"Mia, do you want to buy the knob?" Sam asked. "I will sell it to you for one cookie. It is a good deal. The knob can make sounds and it is shiny."
Mia looked at Sam and felt confused. She did not understand what he meant by sell and buy. She liked cookies, but she did not want the knob. She thought Sam was being silly.
"Sam, I don't want to buy the knob," Mia said. "I don't have any cookies. And I don't like the knob. I like my doll. Why don't you play with your truck? It is a nice truck."
Sam felt more sad. He did not want to play with his truck. He wanted to play with the knob. He did not know why Mia did not like the knob. He thought it was a great toy. He put the knob back on the shelf and climbed down from the couch. He picked up his truck and rolled it on the floor. He made a honk sound.
Mia saw that Sam was unhappy. She felt sorry for him. She wanted to make him happy. She had another idea. She decided to trade her doll for the knob.
"Sam, do you want to trade the knob for my doll?" Mia asked. "I will give you my doll and you give me the knob. Then we can both have new toys. It is a fun game."
Sam looked at Mia and felt surprised. He did not expect her to offer her doll. He liked her doll. It was pretty and soft. He thought it was a nice toy. He smiled and nodded.
"Okay, Mia, let's trade the knob for the doll," Sam said. "That sounds like a fun game. Thank you for being my friend."
Mia smiled and nodded. She gave Sam her doll and took the knob. They hugged and said thank you. Then they played with their new toys. They were happy and had fun. They forgot about selling and buying. They learned about trading and sharing.




Tom likes to play with his computer. He likes to see the pictures and hear the sounds. He likes to press the buttons and make things happen. He has a computer in his room, on his desk.
One day, Tom wants to play with his computer after lunch. He runs to his room and climbs on his chair. He looks for the button to turn on his computer. But he cannot find it. He looks on the side, on the back, on the front. He cannot see the button.
He feels sad and angry. He shouts, "Where is the button? I want to play with my computer!"
His mom hears him and comes to his room. She sees Tom looking for the button. She smiles and says, "Tom, the button is not on the computer. It is on the wall. See, there is a cord that goes from the computer to the wall. The cord needs power to make the computer work. The button on the wall gives power to the cord. You need to turn on the button on the wall first, then you can turn on the computer."
Tom looks at the wall and sees the button. He says, "Oh, I see. Thank you, mom." He goes to the wall and turns on the button. He hears a click and sees a light. He goes back to his desk and turns on his computer. He sees the screen turn from black to colorful. He hears the music and the voices. He smiles and says, "Yay, I can play with my computer now!" He starts to play with his computer and has fun. His mom watches him and feels happy. She says, "Have fun, Tom. I love you." She kisses him and leaves his room. Tom says, "I love you too, mom." He plays with his computer until it is time for a nap.




Anna liked to collect rocks. She had many rocks in her room. Some were big, some were small, some were shiny, some were dull. She liked to look at them and feel them in her hands.
One day, she went to the lake with her mom and dad. The lake was big and blue and had many fish and ducks. Anna saw some rocks on the shore. She ran to them and picked them up. They were different from her rocks at home. They were smooth and wet and had colors like the rainbow.
She put them in her bucket and showed them to her mom and dad. They smiled and said they were pretty. Anna wanted to find more rocks. She walked along the shore and looked for them. She saw something shiny in the water. She went closer and saw a big rock. It was very shiny and had many shapes on it. It looked like a star.
Anna was curious. She wanted to touch the rock. She reached out her hand and touched it. It felt cold and hard. She tried to lift it, but it was too heavy. She pulled harder, but it did not move. She wondered what it was and why it was in the lake. It was a mysterious rock.
She heard her mom and dad calling her. They said it was time to go home. Anna looked at the rock and felt sad. She wanted to take it with her. She said goodbye to the rock and told it she would come back. She ran to her mom and dad and showed them her bucket of rocks. They said they were very nice and put them in the car. Anna was happy. She had collected many rocks today. She hoped the mysterious rock would wait for her. She wanted to see it again.

They put the pizza in the oven and wait. They smell something good. They are hungry. They want to eat the pizza. They open the oven and take out the pizza. It is hot and yummy.
But then, Ben comes in. Ben is rude. He sees the pizza and says, "That is my pizza. Give it to me." He tries to grab the pizza from Tom and Mia. They say, "No, Ben. This is our pizza. We create it. You did not help. Go away."
Ben is angry. He pushes Tom and Mia. He takes the pizza and runs away. He laughs and says, "Ha ha, I have the pizza. You have nothing." He is very rude.

Tim and Lily went to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They saw many animals, like lions, monkeys, and giraffes. But Tim and Lily liked the penguins best. They watched them swim and slide on the ice.
"Can we feed them?" Lily asked Mom.
"No, sweetie, we can't. They have their own food," Mom said.
Tim saw a man with a bucket of fish. He was wearing a blue coat and a hat. He looked like he worked at the zoo.
"Maybe he can give us some fish to feed the penguins," Tim said. He ran to the man and said, "Hello, sir. Can we have some fish, please?"
The man smiled and said, "Sure, kid. You can have one fish each. But be careful, they might bite."
He offered Tim and Lily a fish from the bucket. Tim and Lily thanked him and walked to the penguin pool. They held the fish in their hands and waved them at the penguins.
The penguins saw the fish and came closer. They made loud noises and flapped their wings. Some of them jumped out of the water and tried to grab the fish.
"Wow, they are hungry!" Lily said.
But one penguin was different. He was smaller and quieter than the others. He stayed in the corner of the pool and looked sad.
"What's wrong with him?" Tim asked.
"I don't know. Maybe he is sick or lonely," Lily said.
She felt sorry for the little penguin. She decided to give him her fish. She walked to the edge of the pool and said, "Here, little penguin. This is for you. I hope you like it."
She threw the fish to the penguin. He looked surprised and happy. He caught the fish in his beak and ate it. He waddled to Lily and rubbed his head against her hand. He made a soft noise.
"Aw, he likes you!" Tim said.
Lily smiled and petted the penguin. He felt warm and soft. She said, "You're welcome, little penguin. You're very cute."
The penguin nodded and smiled. He followed Lily wherever she went. He wanted to be her friend.
But the other penguins were not happy. They were jealous and angry. They wanted more fish. They wanted Lily's attention. They started to chase the little penguin and peck at him. They made loud noises and flapped their wings.
"Hey, stop that!" Tim said. He tried to protect the little penguin. He said, "Leave him alone. He's our friend."
But the penguins did not listen. They kept attacking the little penguin. They made him cry.
Lily was scared and sad. She said, "Mom, Dad, help! The penguins are mean to the little penguin. They hurt him."
Mom and Dad heard Lily's cry. They ran to the penguin pool. They saw the penguins fighting. They saw the little penguin bleeding.
They called the man with the bucket. He came and said, "What's going on here?"
He saw the little penguin and said, "Oh, no. He's the new penguin. He just arrived yesterday. He's not used to the others. They don't like him. They bully him."
He picked up the little penguin and said, "Don't worry, little guy. I'll take you to the vet. He'll make you better."
He thanked Tim and Lily for feeding the little penguin. He said, "You're very kind, kids. You made him happy. He likes you. Maybe you can visit him again when he's well."
He took the little penguin away. Tim and Lily waved goodbye. They hoped the little penguin would be okay.
They hugged Mom and Dad. They said, "We're sorry, Mom and Dad. We didn't mean to cause trouble. We just wanted to feed the penguins."
Mom and Dad hugged them back. They said, "It's okay, Tim and Lily. We know you meant well. You did a good thing. You showed the little penguin some love. You're very brave and sweet."
They kissed Tim and Lily. They said, "We're proud of you, kids. We love you."
They left the zoo. They went home. They had a warm and cozy night. They dreamed of the little penguin. They hoped he would be happy. They hoped he would find some friends. They hoped they would see him again.




Sara and Tom were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to make up stories with their dolls and cars. Sara had a big doll with long hair and a pink dress. Tom had a small car with four wheels and a horn.
"Let's pretend that my doll is a princess and your car is a dragon," Sara said. "The dragon wants to take the princess to his cave, but she is frightened and wants to escape."
"OK," Tom said. "But the dragon is very strong and fast. He can catch the princess easily."
Sara and Tom moved their toys around the floor, making noises and voices. Sara made her doll run away from Tom's car, but Tom chased her with his car, honking and growling.
"Help, help!" Sara made her doll cry. "The dragon is coming! He wants to lock me in his cave!"
"No one can help you, princess!" Tom made his car say. "You are mine now! I will part you from your friends and family!"
Sara did not like Tom's game. She felt scared and sad for her doll. She wanted to stop playing, but Tom did not listen. He grabbed her doll with his car and tried to pull her hair.
"Stop it, Tom!" Sara shouted. "You are hurting my doll! Give her back to me!"
"No, I won't!" Tom shouted back. "She is my prisoner! You can't have her!"
Sara and Tom started to tug and pull on the doll's hair. They both wanted to have the doll, but they did not want to share. They got angry and loud. They did not notice that their mom was watching them from the kitchen.
"Hey, hey, hey!" their mom said. "What is going on here? Why are you fighting over the doll?"
Sara and Tom stopped and looked at their mom. They felt ashamed and sorry. They realized that they had been mean and rude to each other.
"We were playing a game, mom," Sara said. "But Tom was too rough and scary. He wanted to lock my doll in his cave and part her from me."
"I was just pretending, mom," Tom said. "But Sara did not like my game. She wanted to keep her doll and not let me play with her."
Their mom sighed and shook her head. She walked over to them and took the doll from their hands. She looked at the doll's hair and saw that it was tangled and pulled.
"Look what you did to the doll," she said. "You ruined her hair. How do you think she feels?"
Sara and Tom looked at the doll and felt bad. They saw that they had hurt the doll and each other.
"We are sorry, mom," they said. "We are sorry, doll."
Their mom smiled and hugged them. She gave them the doll back and helped them fix her hair.
"It's OK, my loves," she said. "I know you were just playing, but you have to be careful and kind. You have to respect each other's toys and feelings. You have to share and take turns. And you have to use your words, not your hands, when you have a problem. OK?"
"OK, mom," Sara and Tom said. "We understand. We will do better."
They hugged their mom and thanked her. Then they hugged each other and apologized. They decided to play a different game, one that they both liked and agreed on. They were happy and friendly again. They learned their lesson.




Lily and Tom were eager to see the fire. They heard the big noise and saw the red light in the sky. They ran to the window and looked outside. They saw the fire truck and the firemen. They saw the water and the smoke. They saw the fire.
"Wow!" Lily said. "Look at the fire! It is so big and bright!"
"Can we go outside and see it?" Tom asked. He wanted to get closer to the fire.
"No, no, no!" Mom said. She came to the window and pulled them away. "The fire is very hot and dangerous. You have to stay inside and be safe."
"But why?" Tom questioned. He did not understand why they could not go outside.
"Because the fire can hurt you and burn you. And the smoke can make you cough and sick. And the firemen have to work hard to stop the fire. You have to listen to Mom and stay inside." Mom explained.
Lily and Tom were sad and curious. They wanted to see the fire, but they also wanted to be safe and healthy. They decided to listen to Mom and stay inside. They watched the fire from the window until it was gone. They hoped that no one was hurt by the fire. They thanked the firemen for their work. They learned that fire is not a toy, but a force of nature.




Tim and Kim were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and a big mattress to jump on. Sometimes they made a fort with the mattress and the blankets and pretended to be pirates or explorers.
One day, their mom told them she had to go to the store and asked them to be good and not make a mess. She said she would be back soon and left them some snacks and juice. Tim and Kim said okay and waved goodbye.
After mom left, Tim and Kim decided to play with the mattress. They dragged it to the middle of the room and started to jump on it. They had fun bouncing and laughing and making silly faces. But then, Tim had an idea.
"Let's make the mattress more fun," he said. "Let's put some juice on it and make it slippery."
Kim thought that was a bad idea. She said, "No, Tim, that's dangerous. We could fall and hurt ourselves. And we could spoil the mattress and make mom angry."
But Tim did not listen. He grabbed a bottle of juice and poured some on the mattress. He said, "Come on, Kim, don't be a baby. It's just juice. It will dry up."
He jumped on the mattress and slid on the juice. He said, "Whee, this is fun. Try it, Kim."
Kim shook her head. She said, "No, Tim, I don't want to. It's not fun, it's stupid. Stop it, Tim, or I'll tell mom."
But Tim did not stop. He poured more juice on the mattress and jumped and slid. He said, "You're no fun, Kim. You're a boring girl. I'm having a blast."
He did not see that the juice was dripping on the floor and making a big puddle. He did not hear that mom was coming back and opening the door. He did not notice that mom was shocked and angry when she saw the mess.
"Tim, Kim, what have you done?" mom yelled. "You spoiled the mattress and the floor. You made a huge mess. You were very naughty and dangerous. How could you do this?"
Tim and Kim stopped jumping and looked at mom. They felt scared and sorry. They said, "We're sorry, mom. We were just playing. We didn't mean to spoil the mattress."
Mom sighed. She said, "Playing is good, but you have to be careful and respectful. You have to listen to each other and to me. You have to clean up your mess and apologize. And you have to promise me you will never do this again."
Tim and Kim nodded. They said, "We promise, mom. We're sorry, mom. We love you, mom."
Mom hugged them. She said, "I love you too, Tim and Kim. But you have to learn from your mistakes. Now, let's get some towels and clean this up. And then, you have to go to bed early. No more playing with the mattress today."




Sam and Mia were twins who liked to explore new places. One day, they went with their mom and dad to visit a big temple. The temple had many stairs, statues, and paintings. Sam and Mia wanted to see everything, so they ran and rushed from one thing to another.
"Slow down, children," their mom said. "You might get lost or hurt yourself. And be respectful of the temple and the people here."
But Sam and Mia did not listen. They kept rushing and running, until they bumped into an elderly man. The man was wearing a long robe and a hat. He was holding a stick and a book. He looked very angry.
"Hey, watch where you are going!" the man shouted. "You have no manners. This is a sacred place, not a playground. You should be quiet and calm, and learn from the wisdom of the temple."
Sam and Mia felt scared and sorry. They realized they had been rude and careless. They apologized to the man and bowed their heads.
"We are sorry, sir," they said. "We did not mean to bother you. We were just curious and excited. But you are right, we should be respectful and learn from the temple."
The man softened his expression and smiled. He saw that the children were sincere and humble. He decided to forgive them and teach them.
"It is good that you are curious and excited, children," he said. "But you must also be careful and mindful. The temple is a place of peace and harmony, where you can find beauty and wisdom. Come, I will show you some of the treasures of the temple, and tell you some of the stories behind them."
Sam and Mia nodded and followed the man. They walked slowly and quietly, and listened attentively. They saw and learned many new things, and felt happy and grateful. They thanked the man for his kindness and generosity.
"You are welcome, children," the man said. "You have learned a valuable lesson today. Remember, always respect the temple and the people, and you will find joy and enlightenment."
The moral of the story is: Respect the temple and the people, and you will find joy and enlightenment.




Sara loved to visit her elderly grandma every week. Grandma had a big garden with many flowers and fruits. Sara liked to smell the roses, pick the strawberries and play with the cat. But her favorite thing was to make lemonade with grandma. Grandma had a big lemon tree that gave many lemons. Sara and grandma would squeeze the lemons, add water and sugar, and stir well. Then they would drink the lemonade together and chat.
But one day, Sara could not visit grandma. She had a cold and had to stay in bed. She felt sad and bored. She missed grandma and the lemonade. She wondered if grandma missed her too. She wished she could see the lemon tree and the cat.
Grandma also missed Sara. She knew Sara was sick and could not come. She prayed for Sara to get well soon. She decided to do something nice for Sara. She picked some lemons from the tree and made a jar of lemonade. She also wrote a note for Sara. She asked her neighbor to deliver the jar and the note to Sara's house.
Sara was surprised and happy when she saw the jar and the note. She read the note. It said: "Dear Sara, I miss you very much. I hope you feel better soon. Here is some lemonade for you. Drink it and think of me. I love you, Grandma." Sara smiled and hugged the jar. She felt warm and loved. She drank some lemonade and felt better. She wrote a note back to grandma.

Lily and Ben were friends who liked to ride their bikes. One day, they rode to the pond near their house. They saw some ducks and fish in the water.
"Look, Ben, the ducks are hungry. Let's give them some bread," Lily said.
"OK, Lily, but we only have a little bread. We need some for ourselves too," Ben said.
They broke the bread into small pieces and threw them to the ducks. The ducks quacked and ate the bread. Lily and Ben smiled and watched them.
But then, a big goose came and chased the ducks away. It ate all the bread and honked loudly. Lily and Ben were scared and angry.
"Hey, goose, that's not nice. You should share with the ducks. They were here first," Lily shouted.
The goose ignored her and looked for more bread. It saw Lily and Ben's bikes and thought they were food. It bit the tires and the seats and made holes in them.
Lily and Ben ran to their bikes and tried to stop the goose. But it was too strong and mean. It pecked at them and made them cry.
"Help, help, someone help us," they screamed.
A man who was walking his dog heard them and came to help. He shooed the goose away and checked their bikes. He saw that they were ruined.
"I'm sorry, kids, your bikes are broken. You can't ride them anymore. What were you doing here?" he asked.
"We were feeding the ducks, but the goose came and took everything. It was greedy and nasty," Lily said.
The man nodded and said, "I see. Well, you were kind and generous to the ducks, but you should also be careful and wise. The pond is not a safe place for kids and bikes. There are many animals and things that can hurt you. Next time, you should ride somewhere else, or ask your parents to come with you."
Lily and Ben thanked the man and his dog. They learned their lesson and never rode to the pond again. They also learned to be more grateful for what they had and to respect other living things.

"Where are they going?" Tom asked Anna.
"I don't know. Maybe they are going to war," Anna said.
"What is war?" Tom asked.
"War is when people fight and hurt each other. It is very bad and sad," Anna said.
"Why do they fight?" Tom asked.
"I don't know. Maybe they are angry or greedy or afraid. Maybe they don't have enough things or love," Anna said.
"That is poor. We have enough things and love. We don't need to fight," Tom said.
"Yes, we are lucky. We have each other and our families and our toys and our books. We can share and help and be kind," Anna said.

Once there was a turtle named Sam. Sam was very tidy and he liked to keep his home clean. His friend, Dave, was often messy and left a lot of things lying around that made it difficult for Sam to keep his home tidy.
One day Dave came to Sam and said, "Let's make an image together!" Sam was excited and brought out some paper, markers and crayons so that they could start to make their image.
But, instead of adding a little bit at a time like Sam wanted, Dave added too much and made a huge mess. Soon the room was filled with papers, markers, and crayons and it was very difficult to see the image.

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Jack. He was just 3 years old, and one day he noticed that some of the clouds in the sky were doing something strange. They were shooting all sorts of different colours of water into the air!
Jack was very curious, so he asked his mom what was happening. His mom smiled and said: "Those are called rainbows! It's when the sun shines on the water droplets in the sky and they spray into colours. It's like a paintbrush!
Jack was so excited. He loved rainbows! That day it was raining, and he kept looking up, hoping to see another one. But then he noticed something else.
The rain was dripping down to the earth and making little puddles, but then he saw something completely different. Some of the puddles were spraying up into the air! They were spraying in different directions like little fountains! Jack was amazed.
He asked his mom what had happened, and she laughed and said "That's called evaporation! The water heats up and turns into a gas, and when that happens, it sprays up into the air!"
Jack couldn't believe it. He'd learned something new about the earth, and he loved it!

The next day, Jax forgot all about the folder until he heard news that his best friend was sick. Jax felt sad and wished he could do something to help his friend. So he took the folder out of his pocket and opened it. To his surprise, time began to move backward and his friend was cured!

Once upon a time, there was a wise old fox who lived in a big forest. Every day, the fox liked to sit in a clearing and think about life. One day, a little bunny hopped over and saw the fox. The bunny asked, "What are you thinking about, fox?" 
The fox said, "I'm thinking about understanding." 
The bunny asked, "What does that mean?" 
The fox replied, "It means to use your head. You understand things when you use your head to think about them." 
The bunny thought for a moment and then asked, "Can I use my head to understand the color of my hair?" 
The fox smiled and said, "Yes, you can." The fox explained if the bunny looked at his hair and thought about it, he could understand why it was the color it was. 
The bunny thanked the fox and hopped away. The fox smiled and knew that the bunny now understood that using your head to think and understand was a very wise thing to do. 
The moral of the story is this: understanding things is important, and it comes from thinking, not from just knowing facts. That's why it's important to be wise and think before you act.

Jimmy ran towards his mother and said, “Mama, the grass is burning!”
His mother quickly ran out and put out the burning grass with a bucket of water.
After the fire stopped, she said to Jimmy, “Please be careful, Jimmy. Burning is not safe. You can get hurt if you don’t be careful.”
But Jimmy just nodded and said, “OK.”

His mother took him to the doctor and they found out that it was a persistent burn from being too close to the fire.

One day, she was playing in the garden when she saw a big, fat, orange bird with a long tail. She asked it, "Please can I have a ride on your back?"
The orange bird said, "No, silly girl! I don't want to help you get around. That's not useful for me. Instead, why don't you get some water and go take a bath? You'll have more fun that way."
The little girl smiled and ran off to get some water. She found a little pond and filled her bucket full of cool, crystal-clear water.

But then, he feels a tickle in his nose. He tries to stop it, but he can't. He sneezes loud and hard. "Achoo!"
Anna hears him and turns around. She sees Ben holding his nose. She runs to him and asks, "Are you okay, Ben?"
Ben nods, but he sneezes again. "Achoo! Achoo!" He wipes his nose with his hand.
Anna looks at him and says, "You need a tissue, Ben. Come, I have one in my purse."
She takes out her pink purse from her backpack. She opens it and looks inside. She has a tissue, a candy, a sticker, and a toy car. She gives the tissue to Ben and says, "Here, use this. It will make you feel better."
Ben takes the tissue and says, "Thank you, Anna. You are very fair. You share your things with me."
He blows his nose and smiles. He feels better. He says, "Can I have a candy, too?"
Anna giggles and says, "Okay, but only one. And then we can go back to the slide. It is fun."
She gives him a candy and takes one for herself. They unwrap them and put them in their mouths. They are sweet and yummy. They say, "Mmm!"
They put their things back in the purse and close it. They hold hands and run to the slide. They slide down together and laugh. They are happy. They are friends.




Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big wire fence. Behind the fence, there are many animals. Lily and Tom want to see the animals.
"Look, Tom, a lion!" Lily says. She points to a big, yellow animal with a mane. "He is so attractive. He has a loud roar."
"Yes, he is attractive, but he is also scary," Tom says. He sees the lion's sharp teeth and claws. "We should not go near him. He might hurt us."
Lily and Tom walk along the fence. They see more animals. They see a zebra, a giraffe, a monkey, and a bird. They are all attractive and different. Lily and Tom are happy.
But then, they see a hole in the fence. The hole is big enough for them to crawl through. Lily and Tom are curious. They want to go inside the fence and touch the animals.
"Come on, Tom, let's go inside," Lily says. She runs to the hole and starts to crawl.
"No, Lily, stop!" Tom says. He runs after her and grabs her hand. "It is not safe. The animals might bite us or kick us. We should stay outside."
Lily and Tom look at each other. They are both afraid and excited. They do not know what to do. Should they go inside or stay outside?




Lily and Ben were playing in their room. They had many toys and books, but they liked to make their own games. They moved the furniture around and made a big fort with a blanket and some pillows. They pretended they were in a cave, hiding from a dragon.
"Shh, be quiet," Lily whispered to Ben. "The dragon is outside. He can smell us and hear us. We have to be smart and trick him."
"How?" Ben asked.
Lily had an idea. She took a flashlight from her backpack and turned it on. She made it glow under the blanket. "Look, we have a magic stone. It can make us invisible. If the dragon comes in, we can use it to escape."
Ben smiled. He liked Lily's idea. He took another flashlight and made it glow too. "We have two magic stones. We are very powerful. The dragon can't hurt us."
They heard a loud roar from outside. It was their dad, playing along. He knocked on the door and said in a deep voice, "I smell children. I smell tasty children. Where are you? I want to eat you."
Lily and Ben giggled. They turned off their flashlights and hid under the blanket. They waited for their dad to come in. They were not scared. They were having fun. They knew their dad loved them and would not really eat them. They were ready to use their magic stones and surprise him.




Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big cat in the park. It has spots on its fur. It is a leopard.
"Wow, look at the leopard!" Tom says. "It is so fit and fast. I want to pet it."
"No, Tom, don't!" Mia says. "The leopard is not a pet. It can bite you. It is wild."
But Tom does not listen. He runs to the leopard. The leopard sees Tom and growls. It shows its teeth. Tom is scared. He stops and cries.
Mia runs to Tom. She hugs him and wipes his tears. "It's okay, Tom. The leopard will not hurt you. It is just scared too. Let's go away and leave it alone."
They walk away from the leopard. The leopard runs away too. It goes back to the woods. Tom and Mia are safe. They are still friends. They learned a lesson. They will not bother wild animals again.




Lily and Tom were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. But today, the park was full of fog. They could not see very far.
"Where are you, Tom?" Lily called. She could not see her friend.
"I'm here, Lily!" Tom answered. He was on the swings. He tried to swing high, but the fog made him slow. He could not see the trees or the sky.
Lily ran to the swings. She saw Tom's shape in the fog. She smiled and joined him. They swung together, back and forth.
"Let's raise our hands and touch the fog!" Lily said. She thought the fog was soft and cool.
"OK, let's do it!" Tom said. He liked to try new things.
They raised their hands and reached for the fog. They felt the wet air on their fingers. They giggled and swung faster.
The fog was like a big blanket. It made them feel cozy and happy. They did not mind that they could not see very far. They had each other and the swings. They had fun in the fog.




Ben and Mia are at the park with Mom. They see a big fountain with water that goes up and down. The water is icy and makes them shiver.
"Can we move closer to the fountain, Mom?" Ben asks. He wants to touch the water and see if it is cold.
"Okay, but be careful. Don't get wet or you will catch a cold," Mom says. She holds their hands and walks with them to the fountain.
Mia sees a shiny coin at the bottom of the fountain. She points at it and says, "Look, Ben, a coin! Maybe someone made a wish."
"Can we make a wish, too?" Ben asks. He likes the idea of making a wish.
"Sure, why not?" Mom says. She gives them each a coin and tells them to close their eyes and think of something they want.
Ben and Mia close their eyes and toss their coins into the fountain. They hear a splash and open their eyes.
"What did you wish for, Ben?" Mia asks.
"I wished for a new bike. What about you?" Ben asks.
"I wished for a puppy. Do you think our wishes will come true?" Mia asks.
"Maybe. But we have to be good and wait and see," Ben says.
They smile and hug Mom. They are happy and hopeful. They like the fountain and the icy water. They think it is magic.




Lily liked to play with her dad's office things. She liked the pens, the papers, the stapler and the calculator. She liked to pretend she was working like her dad. Sometimes, her dad let her sit on his lap and help him with his work.
One day, her dad had a very important work to do. He had to complete a report for his boss. He told Lily he needed to focus and not to disturb him. Lily nodded and said she would be quiet. She took some papers and pens and went to the corner of the office. She wanted to make her own report.
She drew some pictures and wrote some words. She used the stapler to put the papers together. She used the calculator to make some numbers. She was very proud of her report. She wanted to show it to her dad.
She walked to her dad's desk and said, "Dad, look at my report. I completed it for you." She put her report on top of his report. Her dad looked at her report and smiled. He said, "Wow, Lily, this is a very nice report. You did a great job. Thank you for helping me."
He hugged her and kissed her. He said, "But you know, this is my report. I need to send it to my boss. Your report is very pretty, but it is not what my boss wants. And you used some of my expensive papers and pens. Those are for special work only. Next time, please ask me before you use them, okay?"
Lily felt sorry. She said, "I'm sorry, dad. I didn't know. I just wanted to make you happy. Can I keep my report?" Her dad said, "Of course, you can keep your report. It is yours. And you made me very happy. I love you, Lily. But now, I need to finish my report. Can you play with something else for a while?"
Lily said, "Okay, dad. I love you too. I will play with something else." She took her report and went to the corner of the office. She found some toys and books. She played with them quietly. She was happy. She had completed her report. And her dad had liked it.




Tom and Anna are brother and sister. They like to play outside with their dog, Spot. One day, they go to the lake with their mom and dad. The lake is big and blue and has many fish and ducks.
"Can we swim in the lake, mom?" Tom asks.
"Yes, but you have to be careful and stay close to us. And you have to behave, or we will go home," mom says.
"OK, mom. We will behave. Come on, Anna, let's go!" Tom says. He and Anna run to the water and splash each other. Spot follows them and barks happily.
Mom and dad sit on a blanket and watch them. They smile and talk.
"Look, dad, a duck!" Anna says. She points to a brown duck that swims near them. The duck has a green head and a yellow beak.
"Wow, that's a pretty duck. Do you know what kind of duck it is?" dad asks.
Anna thinks for a moment. She remembers what she learned in preschool.
"It's a mallard duck, dad. It's a very intelligent duck. It can find food and make nests and fly far away," Anna says.
"That's right, Anna. You are very intelligent, too. I'm proud of you," dad says.
"Thank you, dad. I love you," Anna says. She hugs dad and kisses him on the cheek.

Anna and Ben were friends. They liked to play in the park. One day, they saw a big fly. It was yellow and black. It buzzed near the flowers.
"Look, a fly!" Anna said. "Let's catch it!"
"No, don't!" Ben said. "It might sting you!"
But Anna did not listen. She ran after the fly. She wanted to touch it. She was not nervous.
Ben was nervous. He did not like flies. He thought they were scary. He followed Anna. He wanted to stop her.
Anna reached out her hand. She almost caught the fly. But the fly was fast. It flew away. It flew near Ben's face.
Ben screamed. He was afraid. He closed his eyes. He felt something on his nose. It was the fly!
Anna saw Ben. She felt sorry. She ran to him. She hugged him.
"It's okay, Ben," she said. "The fly is gone. I'm sorry I chased it. You are my friend."

"Of course, Anna. You can marry spider. If you love spider, you can marry spider," Lily said.
"Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend," Anna said.

"What is that?" Tim asks.
"I don't know. Maybe it is a gift for someone," Mia says.
They go closer to the box and read the tag. It says: "To Tim and Mia, for being good kids. Love, Mom and Dad."
"Wow! It is for us!" Tim says.
"Can we open it?" Mia asks.
They look around and see no one. They decide to open the box. They pull the ribbon and lift the lid. Inside, they see something incredible.
It is a big, fluffy, colorful unicorn. It has a horn, wings, and a long tail. It looks very soft and friendly.

"Look, Mom, we found a balloon!" Tom says. "Can we play with it?"
Mom looks at the balloon and frowns. She sees a label on the string. It says "Danger. Helium gas. Do not inhale or puncture."
"Tom, Mia, this is not a toy. This is a gas balloon. It has air that is different from the air we breathe. It can make you sick or hurt you if you breathe it or pop it. You need to give it back to me right now." Mom says.
"But we want to keep it. We collect things. It is pretty and light." Mia says.
"I know, but this is not a safe thing to collect. It is messy and dangerous. You can collect other things that are not gas. How about we go to the library and find a book about gas and balloons? You can learn more about them and see pictures. Would you like that?" Mom says.
Tom and Mia think for a moment. They like books and pictures. They want to learn more about gas and balloons. They nod and smile.
"Okay, Mom. We will give you the balloon. Can we go to the library now?" Tom says.
"Yes, we can. But first, let's wash our hands. They are very messy from the trash. And let's say thank you to the balloon for being so shiny and light. Maybe someone else can use it later." Mom says.

Lily and Tom are playing with their toy kitchen. They have a scale, some fruits and some pots and pans. They want to make a fruit salad for their mom.
"Let's weigh the fruits first," Lily says. She puts a banana on the scale. "This is one," she counts. Then she puts an apple on the other side. "This is two," she counts. The scale tips to the apple side. "The apple is heavier than the banana," she says.
"Can I try?" Tom asks. He takes the apple and the banana and puts them in a pot. Then he adds some water and some pepper. "I'm making a spicy soup," he says.
"Spicy soup? That sounds yucky," Lily says. She makes a face. "Fruits are not for soup. Fruits are for salad."
Tom stirs the pot with a spoon. "No, it's yummy. You'll see. It just needs a minute to cook," he says.
He puts the pot on the stove and turns the knob. The stove makes a hissing sound. "Look, it's boiling," Tom says. He smells the steam. "Mmm, it smells good."
Lily smells it too. She coughs. "It smells hot. It makes my nose hurt," she says.
Tom takes the pot off the stove. He pours some soup into a bowl. He blows on it. "It's ready. Do you want to try?" he asks.
Lily shakes her head. "No, thank you. I don't like spicy soup. I like sweet salad," she says.
Tom shrugs. "Okay. More for me," he says. He takes a sip of the soup. He makes a funny face. His eyes water. His tongue burns. "Ahh, it's too spicy!" he cries.
Lily laughs. She gives him a glass of water. "Maybe you should stick to salad too," she says.




Lily liked to play with her mom's makeup. She wanted to look fancy like her mom when she went to work. She found a red lipstick, a pink blush and a shiny polish in her mom's drawer. She put them on her face and nails. She looked at herself in the mirror and smiled.
"Wow, you look so fancy, Lily!" said her brother Max, who came into the room. "Can I try some makeup too?"
"No, Max, this is mine!" said Lily. "You are a boy, you don't need makeup!"
"Yes, I do! I want to look fancy too!" said Max. He grabbed the lipstick from Lily's hand and tried to put it on his lips.
"Hey, stop it! Give it back!" said Lily. She pulled the lipstick from Max's hand and they started to fight.
"Ouch, you hurt me!" said Max. He dropped the polish on the floor and it spilled on the carpet.
"Oh no, mom is going to be so mad!" said Lily. She looked at the mess and started to cry.
"What's going on here?" said mom, who heard the noise and came into the room. She saw Lily and Max with makeup on their faces and the polish on the carpet. She was not happy.
"Lily and Max, what did you do?" said mom. "You know you are not supposed to play with my makeup and polish! They are not toys, they are for grown-ups!"
"Sorry, mom," said Lily and Max. They felt bad for making mom angry and for ruining her things.
"Come on, let's go to the bathroom and wash your faces," said mom. "And then we have to clean the carpet and the makeup. Next time, if you want to look fancy, you can ask me first and I will help you."

"Let me see, what happened?" Dad said. He looked at the car and saw the broken wheel. "Oh, I see. This is not a big problem. I can repair it for you. But I need some tools and glue. I will get them from the garage."
"Thank you, Dad!" Ben said.
Dad went to the garage and came back with some tools and glue. He worked on the car and fixed the wheel. He tested the car and it worked again. He gave it back to Sara and Ben.

Sara and Tom were playing in the woods. They liked to build forts with lumber they found on the ground. They had a big pile of lumber near a big tree. They were happy.
But then, a mean man came. He had a big truck and a big saw. He wanted to cut down the big tree and take the lumber. He did not see Sara and Tom. He did not care.
Sara and Tom were scared. They hid behind the lumber pile. They hoped the mean man would go away. But he did not. He started to cut the big tree. The big tree made a loud noise. It fell down. It hit the lumber pile.

"Let's make soup!" said Tom. "We need water, carrots, and onion."
"Okay!" said Lily. "I will get the water and the carrots. You get the onion."
Tom and Lily rushed to get what they needed. They filled the pot with water and put it on the stove. They chopped the carrots and put them in the pot. Then Tom picked up the onion and peeled it.
"Ow! Ow! Ow!" Tom cried. "The onion hurts my eyes! It makes them wet and stingy!"
Lily heard Tom and ran to him. She saw his eyes were red and watery. She felt sorry for him.
"Here, Tom, take this," she said. She gave him a towel to wipe his eyes. "I will chop the onion for you. You can stir the pot."
Tom took the towel and thanked Lily. He was grateful for her help. He went to the stove and stirred the pot. Lily chopped the onion and put it in the pot. They smiled at each other.
Soon, the soup was ready. It smelled good and tasted good. Tom and Lily poured some soup in two bowls and shared it. They were happy and proud of their soup. They hugged each other and said, "We are the best chefs ever!"




Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to climb the trees and swing on the ropes. They saw a big pile of leaves and ran to jump on it.
"Let's split the leaves and make a fort!" Tom said.
"OK, but be careful. There might be bugs or spiders," Lily said.
They split the leaves and made a big wall around them. They felt like they were in a secret place. They pretended they were pirates and had a treasure.
"What is our treasure?" Lily asked.
Tom looked around and saw something shiny under the leaves. He pulled it out and gasped.
"It's a skeleton!" he said.
Lily screamed and dropped the leaves. She saw a white bone with a skull and teeth. She was scared and ran away.
"Wait, Lily, don't go!" Tom said. "It's not a real skeleton. It's a toy. Look, it has a button and a sticker."
He pressed the button and the skeleton made a funny noise. It said, "Boo! I'm a friendly skeleton. Do you want to play with me?"
Tom laughed and showed Lily the toy. He said, "See, it's not scary. It's just a joke. Someone left it here to trick us."
Lily came back and looked at the toy. She saw that it was not real and felt calm. She said, "Oh, I see. It's a silly skeleton. It's not scary at all."
She smiled and took the toy from Tom. She said, "Let's play with it. It can be our treasure. We can make it talk and dance."
They played with the toy skeleton and had fun. They forgot about the leaves and the bugs. They were happy and laughed a lot. They were the best pirates in the park.




Sara likes cereal. She likes to eat it every morning. She likes to put milk and bananas on it. She likes to eat it with a spoon.
One day, Sara sees a new box of cereal. It is black. She does not like black. She thinks black is yucky. She does not want to eat it.
She says to her mom, "Mom, I do not want this cereal. It is black. I want my old cereal. It is yellow and brown. It is yummy."
Her mom says, "Sara, this is a special cereal. It is not yucky. It is crunchy and sweet. It has chocolate in it. Do you like chocolate?"
Sara likes chocolate. She likes to eat it sometimes. She thinks chocolate is yummy. She says, "Yes, I like chocolate. But I do not like black."
Her mom says, "Why don't you try it? Just one bite. Maybe you will like it. It is good for you. It has vitamins and minerals. Do you know what vitamins and minerals are?"
Sara does not know what vitamins and minerals are. She thinks they are hard words. She does not care about them. She cares about yummy and yucky. She says, "No, I do not know. I do not want to try it. I want my old cereal."
Her mom says, "Okay, Sara. I will not make you eat it. But I will eat it. It looks delicious. Can I have some milk and bananas, please?"

Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play together. One night, they hear a noise in the closet. They are scared. It is dark in their room.
"Ben, what is that?" Anna whispers.
"I don't know. Maybe a monster," Ben says.
They hide under the covers. The noise gets louder. They see the closet door open. They scream.
"Anna! Ben! What's wrong?" Mom comes in. She turns on the light.
"Mom, there is a monster in the closet!" Anna cries.
Mom looks in the closet. She smiles.
"No, there is no monster. It is just your clothes. They fell off the hanger. See?" Mom shows them the clothes.
Anna and Ben feel silly. They laugh.
"Sorry, Mom. We were scared," Ben says.
"It's okay. It's normal to be scared sometimes. But there is nothing to be afraid of. Your clothes are not monsters. They are just clothes," Mom says.

Tom was a boy who liked to polish things. He had a cloth and a bottle of polish that he used to make his toys and shoes shiny. He was very proud of his work and liked to show it to his friends.
One day, he went to the park with his mom and saw a big statue of a king. The king had a crown and a sword and a long coat. Tom thought the statue looked dull and dirty. He wanted to make it shiny like his toys and shoes.
He ran to the statue and climbed on it. He took out his cloth and polish and started to rub the king's face. He did not see the sign that said "Do not touch". He did not hear his mom calling him to come down. He did not notice the people staring at him.
"Hey, what are you doing?" a loud voice said. Tom looked up and saw a man in a uniform. He had a badge and a hat and a whistle. He was a guard. He was angry.
"I'm polishing the king," Tom said. "He looks sad and dirty. I want to make him happy and shiny."
The guard frowned and blew his whistle. He grabbed Tom and lifted him off the statue. He scolded him and told him he was not allowed to touch the statue. He said he could damage it and get in trouble.
Tom felt scared and embarrassed. He did not mean to do anything bad. He just wanted to polish the king. He started to cry and said he was sorry.
The guard softened and gave Tom a tissue. He said he understood that Tom liked to polish things, but he had to be careful and respectful of the statue. He said the statue was very old and important and needed to be protected. He said Tom could polish other things, like his bike or his spoon, but not the statue.
Tom nodded and wiped his tears. He said he was sorry again and promised not to touch the statue anymore. He hugged his mom and said he wanted to go home.
The guard smiled and said it was okay. He said he hoped Tom learned his lesson and would be more careful next time. He said he liked to polish things too, when he was a boy. He said he had a polish for his badge and his hat and his whistle. He said he would show Tom how to use it, if he wanted.
Tom smiled and said yes. He said he liked the guard and his polish. He said he wanted to be a guard when he grew up. He said he would polish his badge and his hat and his whistle every day.
The guard laughed and said he was glad. He said he would be happy to have Tom as a friend and a helper. He said he would teach Tom how to be a good guard and how to respect the king. He said he would let Tom polish his badge and his hat and his whistle, once in a while.
Tom was happy. He said he liked the king and his statue. He said he wanted to make him happy and shiny, but not with his polish. He said he would make him happy and shiny with his smile and his wave and his thank you. He said he would be a good boy and a good guard and a good friend.

They run to the dog and shout, "Stop! Go away! You are not nice!" The dog does not listen. He keeps barking and running. Lila and Ben look for something to make him leave. They see a hose. They turn on the water and spray the dog. The dog gets wet and cold. He does not like it. He runs away.

Lily and Ben were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat soup and bread. Lily wanted some salt on her bread, but the salt was on the other side of the table. She tried to reach for it, but she could not. She asked her mom to pass the salt, but her mom was busy talking on the phone.
"Mom, can you give me the salt, please?" Lily said.
But her mom did not hear her. Lily felt angry. She wanted the salt now. She stood up on her chair and stretched her arm. She almost touched the salt, but then she lost her balance. She fell off the chair and knocked over the soup bowl. The soup spilled all over the table and the floor. Lily cried out loud.
Mom heard the noise and dropped the phone. She ran to Lily and hugged her. She was frightened. She checked if Lily was hurt.
"Lily, are you okay? What happened?" Mom asked.
"I wanted the salt, but I could not reach it. I fell and made a mess. I'm sorry, Mom." Lily said.
Mom kissed Lily and said, "It's okay, sweetie. I'm glad you're not hurt. But you should not stand on the chair. That's dangerous. Next time, just wait for me or ask Ben to help you. Okay?"
Lily nodded and said, "Okay, Mom. I'm sorry, Ben."
Ben smiled and said, "It's okay, Lily. I'll help you clean up. And I'll share my salt with you."

One day, they hear a loud noise from the garden. They run outside and see a big rabbit nibbling on their radishes. The rabbit has long ears, a fluffy tail and a pink nose. It looks harmless, but Sam and Mia are angry.
"Hey, stop that!" Sam shouts. "Those are our radishes, not yours!"
The rabbit looks up and sees the twins. It is scared and hops away, dropping a radish on the ground.
"Come back here, you thief!" Mia yells. "You owe us a radish!"
The twins chase the rabbit, but it is too fast and disappears into the bushes. Sam and Mia are out of breath and sad. They look at their patch and see that the rabbit has eaten many of their radishes.
"Oh no, what are we going to do?" Sam asks. "We worked so hard to grow them."
Mia thinks for a moment. Then she smiles and says, "Don't worry, Sam. We still have some radishes left. And we have carrots and lettuce too. We can share them with the rabbit. Maybe he is hungry and lonely. Maybe he can be our friend."
Sam nods and smiles too. He picks up the radish that the rabbit dropped and says, "Okay, Mia. Let's share our vegetables with the rabbit. Maybe he will come back and say sorry. Maybe he will hear us and be nice."
The twins go back to their patch and make a pile of radishes, carrots and lettuce. They leave a note that says, "For the rabbit. From Sam and Mia. We want to be your friends."
They hope that the rabbit will see their note and their vegetables and come back. They hope that the rabbit will hear their words and be kind. They hope that they can all play in the garden together.




Tommy liked to ride his bike in the park. He had a red bike with two big wheels and a shiny pedal. He could go very fast and make loud noises with his mouth. He felt happy and free on his bike.
But Tommy was not nice to other kids. He did not share his bike or his toys. He did not listen to his mom or his dad. He did not say sorry or thank you. He was ignorant and rude. He thought he was better than everyone else.
One day, he saw a little girl with a yellow bike. She had a basket with flowers and a bell that rang. Tommy wanted her bike. He rode up to her and said, "Give me your bike. It is mine now. You are stupid and ugly." The little girl was scared and sad. She said, "No, this is my bike. I got it for my birthday. Please go away." Tommy did not care. He pushed her off her bike and took it. He laughed and rode away.
But Tommy did not know how to ride the yellow bike. It was smaller and lighter than his red bike. It had a different pedal and a brake. Tommy did not pay attention to the road. He did not see the big truck that was coming. He did not hear the horn that was honking. He did not feel the bump that was ahead.
The truck hit Tommy and his yellow bike. There was a loud crash and a lot of pain. Tommy flew off the bike and landed on the ground. He was bleeding and broken. He cried and screamed. The little girl ran to him and tried to help. She was kind and brave. She said, "I'm sorry, Tommy. I hope you are okay." Tommy did not answer. He shut his eyes and did not open them again. He was gone.




Anna and Ben like to play with blocks. They have many blocks of different colors and shapes. They can create many things with blocks, like houses, towers, bridges, and animals.
One day, they decide to create a maze with blocks. A maze is a path with many turns and walls. They want to make a big maze that they can walk inside. They start to put blocks on the floor, making walls and gaps. They use red blocks, blue blocks, yellow blocks, and green blocks.
"Look, Anna, I made a long wall with blue blocks!" Ben says.
"Good, Ben, but we need more gaps. A maze has to have gaps, so we can go through," Anna says.
"OK, Anna, I will make some gaps. How about this one?" Ben says, and makes a gap with two green blocks.
"That's too small, Ben. We can't fit through that gap. We need bigger gaps," Anna says.
"Fit means to go inside something, right?" Ben asks.
"Yes, Ben, fit means to go inside something. Like when you fit your foot in your shoe, or when you fit your toy in your box," Anna explains.
"I see, Anna. Then I will make bigger gaps. How about this one?" Ben says, and makes a gap with four yellow blocks.
"That's better, Ben. We can fit through that gap. Let's make more gaps like that," Anna says.

She finds a pair of scissors and starts to cut her own hair. She cuts off a big chunk of her bangs and drops it on the floor. She looks in the mirror and gasps.
"Oh no," she says. "I look funny. I don't look like a princess anymore."
Ben sees what she did and laughs. He picks up the scissors and cuts his own hair too. He cuts off a piece of his sideburns and puts it on his chin. He looks in the mirror and grins.
"I look funny too," he says. "I look like a pirate."

Lily liked to watch her mom change her baby brother's diaper. She wanted to help, but mom said she was too little. Lily felt sad. She wished she could do big things like mom.
One day, mom was busy in the kitchen. She asked Lily to watch her brother for a minute. Lily was happy. She ran to the crib and saw her brother crying. He had a dirty diaper. Lily thought she could change it. She grabbed a new diaper and some wipes from the shelf.

Lily was an adventurous girl who liked to explore new places. One day, she saw a big hill covered with snow. She wanted to slide down the hill on her sled. She put on her red mitten and ran to the hill.
But when she got there, she saw that there was another boy on the hill. He was also sliding on his sled. He had a blue mitten. He looked at Lily and said, "This is my hill. You can't slide here. Go away."
Lily felt sad and angry. She said, "No, this is not your hill. This is a big hill for everyone. I want to slide too. You have to share."
The boy said, "No, I don't have to share. I was here first. You have to yield. That means you have to let me go first and wait for your turn."
Lily said, "No, you have to yield too. That means you have to take turns and be fair. You can't have the hill all the time."
The boy and Lily started to argue. They did not listen to each other. They did not have fun. They only made noise.
Then, they heard a loud roar. They looked up and saw a big bear coming down the hill. The bear was hungry and angry. He saw the boy and Lily and wanted to eat them.
The boy and Lily were very scared. They forgot about their sleds and their mittens. They ran away from the hill as fast as they could. They did not stop until they reached their homes.
They learned a lesson that day. They learned that it is better to share and yield than to fight and be greedy. They learned that being adventurous is good, but being careful is also good. They learned that sometimes, a big hill is not worth a big trouble.

One day, Lily found a big book on her shelf. It was yellow and heavy. Lily opened the book and saw many words. The words were in order, from A to Z. Lily did not know what the book was. She asked her mom.

"Look, Mia, there are dolphins!" Tom said, pointing to the water. He saw some gray and white shapes jumping and splashing. They were beautiful and fast. Mia smiled and clapped her hands. She loved dolphins.
But the boat did not like the dolphins. It had a big net that it threw into the water. It wanted to catch the dolphins and take them away. The dolphins were scared and tried to swim away. But the net was too big and strong. Some of the dolphins got stuck in the net. They cried and struggled.
"Stop, stop, stop!" Tom shouted at the boat. He was angry and sad. He did not want the boat to hurt the dolphins. He wanted the dolphins to be free and happy. Mia shouted too. She wanted to help the dolphins.

"This is a good place to play," Lily says. "It is cool and nice here. We are in the shade."
"What is shade?" Ben asks. He does not know this word.
Lily points to the sun and the tree. "Shade is when something blocks the sun. The tree blocks the sun, so we are in the shade. It is not too hot or too bright here."
"Oh, I see," Ben says. He learns a new word. "Shade is good. I like shade."

Lily and Sam were best friends. They liked to play with their bikes in the park. Lily had a pink bike with a basket and a bell. Sam had a blue bike with a pedal and a horn.
One day, they saw a new boy in the park. He had a big bike with a lot of stickers and lights. He rode very fast and made loud noises. He stopped near Lily and Sam and said, "Hi, I'm Max. Do you want to see my bike? It's the best bike in the world!"
Lily and Sam looked at his bike. They thought it was too flashy and noisy. They liked their bikes better. They said, "No, thank you. We're happy with our bikes. They're regular bikes, but they're fun."
Max was angry. He wanted them to admire his bike. He said, "Your bikes are boring and old. You don't know anything about bikes. You're silly and stupid."
Lily and Sam felt hurt by his words. They decided to ignore him. They rode away from him and went to the other side of the park. They played with their bikes and had a good time. They didn't care about Max and his bike. They were still best friends.

"Come, Jen, let's see what is in the pan," Tim says.
"No, Tim, we should not. Mom said the stove is hot and we can get hurt," Jen says.
But Tim does not listen. He climbs on a chair and reaches for the pan. He does not see the flame under the pan. He grabs the handle and pulls. The pan is very hot. Tim screams and drops the pan. The pan falls on the floor and makes a loud noise. The pan is full of soup. The soup spills everywhere. It is a big mess.
Mom hears the noise and runs to the kitchen. She sees Tim and Jen and the soup and the pan. She is very angry and scared.

Tim and Jen are very ashamed. They know they did a bad thing. They look at Mom and say sorry.
"Sorry, Mom, we were curious. We wanted to see the pan. We did not mean to make a mess," Tim and Jen say.
Mom hugs them and says, "I'm glad you are not hurt, but you have to be careful. The kitchen is not a place to play. You have to listen to me and follow the rules. Do you understand?"
Tim and Jen nod and say, "Yes, Mom, we understand. We will not do it again."
Mom says, "Good. Now help me clean up the soup and the pan. And then we can have some cookies and milk."
Tim and Jen help Mom clean up. They learn their lesson. They are sorry and ashamed, but they are also happy and grateful. They love Mom and Mom loves them.

Ben likes to play with his toy cars. He has many cars of different colors and sizes. He likes to make them zoom and crash on the floor. He also likes to count his cars. He knows how to say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.
One day, Ben's mom gives him a new car. It is big and shiny and cool. It has a button on the side. Ben's mom says, "This is a special car, Ben. If you press the button, it will repeat what you say. Do you want to try it?"
Ben nods and presses the button. He says, "Hello, car!" The car says, "Hello, car!" Ben laughs and presses the button again. He says, "I like you, car!" The car says, "I like you, car!" Ben is very happy and hugs the car.
Ben decides to count his cars with the new car. He puts the car on the table and points to his other cars. He says, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." The car says, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." Ben claps and says, "Good job, car!"
Then, Ben sees a circle on the car's door. He wonders what it is. He asks the car, "What is this, car?" The car says, "What is this, car?" Ben says, "This is a circle, car." The car says, "This is a circle, car." Ben says, "No, no, car. This is not a circle. This is a zero. Do you know what a zero is, car?" The car says, "Do you know what a zero is, car?" Ben says, "A zero is nothing, car. It means you have no cars. Like this." He takes away all his other cars and leaves only the new car on the table. He says, "Zero cars, car." The car says, "Zero cars, car."
Ben thinks this is funny and laughs. He says, "Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car." He repeats it over and over. The car repeats it over and over. Ben's mom hears the noise and comes to see what is going on. She sees Ben and the car saying, "Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car." She says, "Ben, what are you doing? Where are your other cars?"
Ben looks at his mom and says, "Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car." The car says, "Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car. Zero cars, car." Ben's mom says, "Oh, no, Ben. You have to stop that. You have to share your cars with the car. The car is your friend, not your zero. Come on, let's put your cars back on the floor and play nicely."
Ben says, "Okay, mom. I'm sorry, car. You are not my zero. You are my cool car. I will share my cars with you. Come on, let's play." The car says, "Okay, mom. I'm sorry, car. You are not my zero. You are my cool car. I will share my cars with you. Come on, let's play." Ben and the car smile and play with the other cars. Ben's mom smiles and watches them. She thinks, "That was a close one. I hope Ben learned his lesson. I wonder what else the car can repeat."




Lily was a little girl who liked to mail letters to her friends. She had many stickers and crayons to make her letters pretty. One day, she found a big spider in her room. She was scared of the spider and wanted to get rid of it. She had an idea. She put the spider in a box and wrote a letter to her friend Tom. She said, "Hi Tom, I have a surprise for you. Open the box and see. Love, Lily."
She took the box and the letter to the mailman. He smiled and said, "What a nice letter, Lily. I'm sure Tom will be happy to get it." He put the box and the letter in his bag and drove away.
Tom was excited when he saw the letter from Lily. He liked Lily and wanted to be her friend. He opened the letter and read it. He wondered what the surprise was. He opened the box and saw the spider. He screamed and threw the box away. The spider crawled out and bit him on the hand. It hurt a lot and his hand swelled up. He ran to his mom and cried. She took him to the doctor and he got a shot. He was very angry at Lily and never wanted to talk to her again.
Lily did a bad thing. She was mean to Tom and the spider. She hurt them both and lost a friend. She learned that you should not mail spiders to people. You should mail nice things, like flowers or cards or cookies. You should be kind and gentle to animals, even if you are afraid of them. They have feelings too and can be mighty. You should treat others the way you want to be treated. That is the golden rule.




Lily and Sam were playing with crayons. They liked to draw and color on paper. Lily had a red crayon and Sam had a blue one. They were having fun.
But then Sam wanted to use the red crayon too. He tried to take it from Lily's hand. Lily did not like that. She said, "No, Sam, this is my crayon. You have your own crayon. Go away!"
Sam did not listen. He pulled harder on the red crayon. Lily pulled back. They both started to yell. "Stop, stop, stop!" they said.
Mom heard the noise. She came to see what was wrong. She saw Lily and Sam fighting over the crayon. She was angry. She said, "Lily and Sam, what are you doing? You are not being nice to each other. You are not sharing. You are making a mess. Stop it right now!"
Lily and Sam stopped. They looked at Mom. They felt sorry. They said, "Sorry, Mom. We were being bad. We will share. We will be good."
Mom smiled. She said, "That's better. I'm glad you are sorry. Now, why don't you draw a picture together? You can use both crayons. You can make a new color. What color do you get when you mix red and blue?"
Lily and Sam thought for a moment. Then they said, "Purple!"
Mom said, "That's right. Purple is a beautiful color. Why don't you draw a purple flower? Or a purple butterfly? Or a purple anything you like?"
Lily and Sam nodded. They took the crayons and the paper. They started to draw and color. They were happy. They said, "Thank you, Mom. We love you. We love purple."




Tom and Lily were hungry. They wanted to eat lunch. They looked in the fridge. They saw a bowl of salad. It had lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and eggs.
"Can we have salad, Mom?" Tom asked.
"Sure, honey. But be careful. Some of the salad is old. It might rot. Rot means bad and yucky. You don't want to eat rot salad. It will make you sick." Mom said.
"How do we know which salad is rot and which is not?" Lily asked.
"Look at the color and the smell. If the salad is brown or green or smells funny, it is rot. If the salad is fresh and crisp and smells good, it is not rot. You can also ask me if you are not sure." Mom said.
Tom and Lily took some salad from the bowl. They checked the color and the smell. They found some good salad and some rot salad. They put the good salad on their plates and threw the rot salad in the trash.
"Mom, can we have some dressing for the salad?" Tom asked.
"Of course, dear. What kind of dressing do you like?" Mom asked.
"I like ranch dressing. It is creamy and yummy." Tom said.
"I like honey mustard dressing. It is sweet and tangy." Lily said.
Mom smiled. She was generous. She gave Tom and Lily some dressing for their salad. They poured the dressing on their salad and mixed it well. They ate their salad and enjoyed it.
"Thank you, Mom. The salad was delicious." Tom and Lily said.
"You're welcome, my loves. I'm glad you liked it. And I'm proud of you for being smart and careful with the salad. You don't want to eat rot food. It is bad for you." Mom said.
They hugged Mom and gave her a kiss. They were happy and full. They cleaned their plates and put them in the sink. They went to play with their toys. They had a good lunch.




Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big house near the park. It has many windows and a big door. Lila says, "Who lives in that house?"
Ben says, "I don't know. Maybe someone wealthy. Wealthy means they have a lot of things and money."
Lila says, "I want to see what they have. Maybe they have toys and books and candy. Can we go inside?"
Ben says, "No, we can't. That is not our house. We can't take things that are not ours. That is wrong."
Lila says, "But I'm curious. Maybe they have something interesting. Maybe they have history. History means things that happened a long time ago."
Ben says, "History is not a thing you can take. History is a story you can learn. You can learn history from books or from people who know. But you can't take history from someone else's house. That is rude."
Lila says, "Oh, I see. You are right. History is not a thing you can take. History is a story you can learn. Maybe we can ask someone who lives in that house to tell us their history. Maybe they will be nice and share."
Ben says, "Maybe. But we have to be polite and ask first. We can't just go inside. We have to knock on the door and say hello. And we have to say thank you and goodbye. And we have to listen and not touch anything. Do you understand?"
Lila says, "Yes, I understand. Let's go and knock on the door and say hello. Maybe we will learn something new. Maybe we will make a new friend."

But the mouse does not come out. The mouse is scared of Tom. The mouse knows Tom does not want to play. Tom wants to eat him.
Tom sticks his head into the hole. He tries to find the mouse. He does not see the mouse. He only sees darkness. He feels something move. He thinks it is the mouse. He bites it.
But it is not the mouse. It is a snake. The snake has a long tail too. The snake is angry. The snake bites Tom back.

"Let me stir, Lily!" Ben said. He grabbed the spoon from Lily's hand.
"No, Ben, it's my turn!" Lily said. She pulled the spoon back.
They both tugged on the spoon, making the batter splash out of the bowl. Some of it landed on the fan that was on the counter. The fan was on, so it blew the batter all over the kitchen.
"Oh no!" Lily and Ben said. They saw the mess they made. They saw Mom coming into the kitchen.
"What are you two doing?" Mom asked. She looked at the batter on the walls, the floor, the fan and her children.
"We wanted to make a cake for you, Mom," Lily said.
"But we had a fight over the spoon," Ben said.

Lily and Ben felt sorry. They hugged Mom and said they were sorry.
"It's okay, sweeties," Mom said. "I love you both. And I appreciate your jolly idea. But maybe we can make a cake together another day."
Lily and Ben nodded. They helped Mom clean the kitchen. They learned their lesson. They decided to make a card for Mom instead of a cake. They used crayons and stickers and wrote "We love you, Mom" on it. Mom smiled when she saw the card. She gave them a big hug and a kiss. She said they were the best children ever.




Lily and Ben were hungry. They wanted to eat lunch. But Mom said they had to wait. She was making a tasty thing in the oven.
"What is it, Mom?" Lily asked.
"It's a surprise, sweetie. You'll see soon," Mom said.
Lily and Ben looked at the oven. They smelled something good. They heard a beep.
"Is it ready, Mom?" Ben asked.
"Not yet, honey. The oven says we have to delay a little more. It needs more time to cook," Mom said.
Lily and Ben sighed. They were very hungry. They went to the living room. They played with their toys. They tried to forget about the tasty thing.
But they could not. They kept looking at the clock. They kept hearing the oven. They kept smelling the food.
Finally, Mom called them. "Lunch is ready, kids! Come and see what I made!"
Lily and Ben ran to the kitchen. They saw a big thing on the table. It was round and brown and cheesy. It had slices of tomato and ham on top.

But then, Spot sees a big goose. The goose is angry and loud. It flaps its wings and hisses at Spot. Spot is fearful and barks at the goose. Ben and Lily are fearful too. They do not like the goose.
Mom hears the noise and comes to the pond. She sees the goose and Spot. She calls Spot and holds him. She tells Ben and Lily to stay away from the goose. She says the goose is not nice and can hurt them.
Ben and Lily nod and hug Mom. They are glad Mom is here. They do not want to play near the pond anymore. They want to go to the swings and the slide. They say bye to the ducks and the fish and the frogs and the bugs. They say bye to the birds and the bees. They do not say bye to the goose. They are still fearful of the goose.

Sara and Ben liked to play near the pond. The pond had many fish and frogs and ducks. Sara and Ben liked to watch them swim and jump and quack. Sometimes they threw bread for the ducks and they came closer.
One day, Sara and Ben saw a bright yellow duckling in the pond. It was very small and fluffy and cute. Sara and Ben wanted to pet it and hold it. They went to the edge of the pond and called the duckling.
"Come here, little duckling, we want to be your friends," Sara said.
"Quack, quack," the duckling said and swam towards them.
Sara and Ben reached out their hands and gently touched the duckling. It felt soft and warm. The duckling liked Sara and Ben and nuzzled their fingers.
"Can we take it home, please?" Sara asked.
"No, we can't," Ben said. "The duckling belongs to the pond. It has a family here. See, there is its mother and its brothers and sisters. They are looking for it."
Sara and Ben looked and saw a big white duck and four other yellow ducklings swimming in the pond. They were quacking loudly and looking for the missing duckling.
"You're right, Ben," Sara said. "The duckling belongs to the pond. We should let it go."

"Ready, set, go!" Ben said. He pushed his red car as hard as he could. It zoomed along the tape and stopped at the crayon. "Wow, that's far!" Ben said. He looked at the tape and saw the number 10.
"My turn!" Sam said. He pushed his blue car with all his might. It went faster than Ben's car and passed the crayon. "Ha, I win!" Sam said. He looked at the tape and saw the number 12.

Lily and Max were playing with their toys in the yard. Lily had a doll and Max had a truck. Max liked to make loud noises with his truck and pretend it was driving on the grass. Lily liked to imagine that her doll was a princess and talk to her softly.
"Vroom, vroom, beep, beep!" Max shouted, as he moved his truck closer to Lily and her doll. "Move out of the way, princess! My truck is faster and stronger than you!"
"Stop it, Max!" Lily said, as she hugged her doll. "You are being mean and ignorant. You don't know anything about princesses. They are kind and smart and beautiful. And they don't like noisy trucks!"
"Ha, ha, ha!" Max laughed, as he pushed his truck into Lily and her doll. "You are silly and boring, Lily. You don't know anything about trucks. They are fun and powerful and cool. And they don't care about stupid dolls!"
Lily and Max started to argue and fight. They did not listen to each other or share their toys. They did not have fun or learn anything new.
Mom heard the noise and came to the yard. She saw Lily and Max crying and angry. She saw the doll and the truck on the ground. She was not happy.
"What is going on here?" Mom asked, as she picked up the doll and the truck. "Why are you fighting over your toys? Why are you not playing nicely?"
Lily and Max tried to explain, but they only blamed each other. They said that the other one was ignorant and did not understand their toys.
Mom shook her head and sighed. She sat down with Lily and Max and gave them back their toys. She looked at them with love and said:
"Lily and Max, you are both wrong. You are not ignorant, but you are acting like it. You are not respecting each other or your toys. You are missing a chance to imagine and explore together. You can learn from each other and have more fun if you share your toys and your ideas. Do you understand?"
Lily and Max nodded and felt sorry. They said sorry to each other and hugged. They decided to try to play together and imagine new things. They asked Mom to join them and tell them stories about princesses and trucks. They smiled and laughed and had fun. They were not ignorant anymore.

One day, they had a big fight over the ball. Lily wanted to play with it first, but Max said he had it first. They both pulled and pushed the ball, and shouted at each other. They were not polite at all.
Their mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw the twins fighting over the ball, and was not happy. She said they had to choose: either they share the ball nicely, or they lose the ball for the rest of the day. She said she would count to three, and then take the ball away.
Lily and Max looked at each other, and then at the ball. They both loved the ball, and did not want to lose it. They remembered how much fun they had playing with it together, and how big and beautiful the earth was. They decided to be polite and share the ball.
They said sorry to each other, and gave each other a hug. They said thank you to their mom, and took turns playing with the ball. They had a lot of fun, and learned to be kind and fair. Their mom was proud of them, and gave them a big smile. She said they had made a good choice.

But mom did not think it was fun or funny. Mom saw the water and the mess. She heard the dog and the cat and the bird. She saw Lily with the hose. She was angry and upset. She ran outside and took the hose from Lily. She turned it off and scolded Lily. She said Lily was naughty and bad. She said Lily had to clean up and say sorry.

Lily and Max did not want to organize. They wanted to play more. They said, "No, Mommy, we are having fun. We do not want to organize."
Mommy said, "If you do not organize, you will lose your things. And some of them are fragile. They can break easily. Like this umbrella. It is fragile. It can rip or bend. You have to be careful with it."
Lily and Max looked at the umbrella. It was pink and purple and had flowers on it. It was Lily's favorite umbrella. She did not want it to break. She said, "Okay, Mommy, we will organize. I will put the umbrella in the closet. Where should I put the other things?"

She took a red crayon and started to mark on the shirt. She made big circles and lines and dots. She smiled and said, "Look, Ben, I made a pretty shirt!"
Ben looked at the shirt and frowned. He knew it was not their shirt. It was Mom's shirt. She wore it to work. He said, "Lily, no! You can't mark on Mom's shirt! She will be mad!"

Lily and Ben looked at each other. They felt sorry. They said, "We're sorry, Mom. We wanted to make you a pretty shirt."
Mom sighed. She said, "I know you meant well, but you can't mark on things that are not yours. You have to ask first. And you have to use paper, not clothes. Do you understand?"
Lily and Ben nodded. They said, "We understand, Mom. We won't do it again."
Mom hugged them. She said, "I love you, but you have to be careful. Now, let's go and wash the shirt. Maybe we can save it."

Sara and Ben nodded and thanked their mom. They opened the gift and saw a shiny purple bike. They both wanted to ride it first. Sara said, "I want to go first, I am older by two minutes." Ben said, "No, I want to go first, I am bigger by two inches." They started to fight and pull the bike.
Their mom heard them and came back. She said, "Stop fighting, you two. You have to yield and take turns with the bike, or I will take it away." Sara and Ben said, "Sorry, mom." They decided to flip a coin to see who would go first. Sara won the coin toss and got to ride the bike first.
She put on her helmet and rode the bike around the yard. She felt happy and proud. She did not want to yield and let Ben have a turn. She said, "This is my bike, I won the coin toss. You can wait." Ben felt sad and angry. He said, "That is not fair, you have to yield and let me have a turn. Mom said so." Sara said, "No, I don't. Go away." She rode the bike faster and faster.
She did not see the big rock in her way. She hit the rock and fell off the bike. She hurt her knee and cried. The bike was broken too. Ben ran to help her. He said, "Are you okay, Sara?" Sara said, "No, I am not. I hurt my knee and the bike is broken. Mom will be mad at us." Ben said, "I am sorry, Sara. I wish you had yielded and let me have a turn. Maybe we could have avoided the rock." Sara said, "I am sorry too, Ben. I was selfish and greedy. I should have yielded and let you have a turn. Maybe we could have enjoyed the bike together."
Their mom came and saw what happened. She said, "Oh, no. What did you do, Sara and Ben? You broke the bike and hurt yourselves. You did not yield and take turns with the gift, did you?" Sara and Ben said, "No, mom. We did not. We are sorry, mom." Their mom said, "I am sorry too, Sara and Ben. You have to learn to yield and share with each other, or you will lose what you have and hurt yourselves and others. The bike was a gift, not a prize. You have to be grateful and generous, not selfish and greedy. Do you understand?" Sara and Ben said, "Yes, mom. We understand. We will try to do better next time."
The moral of the story is: You have to yield and share with others, or you will lose what you have and hurt yourselves and others.

Lily was a little girl who liked to play in the garden. She liked to look at the pretty flowers and the busy bees. One day, she saw a big jar of honey on the table. She wanted to taste the honey, because it looked sweet and yummy.
She tried to reach the jar, but it was too high for her. She looked around and saw a chair. She had an idea. She pushed the chair to the table and climbed on it. She was very careful not to fall. She stretched her arm and tried to lift the jar of honey.
But the jar was too heavy for her. She could not lift it. She pulled and pulled, but the jar did not move. She felt sad and frustrated. She started to cry.
Then, she heard a voice. It was her mom. She came to the garden and saw Lily on the chair. She asked her what was wrong. Lily pointed to the jar of honey and said, "I want honey, but I can't lift it. It's too heavy."
Her mom smiled and hugged her. She said, "Don't cry, Lily. I can help you. Honey is very heavy, but it is also very sticky. If you lift it, it might spill and make a mess. How about we share some honey on a slice of bread? That way, you can taste the honey and not waste it."
Lily nodded and smiled. She liked that idea. She got down from the chair and followed her mom to the kitchen. They made some honey bread and ate it together. It was delicious.

Lila and Ben were playing in the backyard. They had a big box and some shiny paper. They wanted to make a pretend spaceship.
"Let's deliver some crystals to the moon," Lila said. She had a necklace with a blue crystal that sparkled in the sun.

"Roar!" The alien jumped out and ran towards them. It wanted the crystal.
"Help!" Lila and Ben screamed. They dropped the crystal and ran back to the box. They closed the flap and locked it.
"Go away, you fierce alien!" Ben shouted. He waved his laser gun. "We don't want to play with you!"
The alien picked up the crystal and looked at it. It liked the shiny thing. It smiled and made a friendly noise. It wanted to play with Lila and Ben.
"Hello, I'm Zog. I'm not fierce. I'm lonely. Can I be your friend?" The alien said. It knocked on the box.
Lila and Ben heard the alien. They were scared, but also curious. They opened the flap and peeked out. They saw the alien holding the crystal. It looked sad.
"Hi, I'm Lila. This is Ben. We're sorry we ran away. We thought you were fierce," Lila said.
"I'm sorry I scared you. I just wanted to see the crystal. It's so pretty. Can I share it with you?" Zog said.
